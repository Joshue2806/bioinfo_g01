AB  - Reductionist strategies aim to understand the mechanisms of complex systems by 
      studying individual parts and their interactions. In this review, we discuss how 
      reductionist approaches have shed light on the structure, function, and production 
      of a complex biomaterial - hagfish defensive slime. Hagfish slime is an extremely 
      dilute hydrogel-like material composed of seawater, mucus, and silk-like proteins 
      that can deploy rapidly. Despite being composed almost entirely of water, hagfish 
      slime has remarkable physical properties, including high strength and toughness. 
      While hagfish slime has a promising future in biomimetics, including the development 
      of eco-friendly high-performance fibers, recreating hagfish slime in the lab has 
      been a difficult challenge. Over the past two decades, reductionist experiments have 
      provided a wealth of information about the individual components of hagfish slime. 
      However, a reductionist approach provides a limited understanding because hagfish 
      defensive slime, like most biological phenomena, is more than just the sum of its 
      parts. We end by providing some thoughts about how the knowledge generated in the 
      last few decades might be synthesized into a working model that can explain hagfish 
      slime structure and function.

LID - 20180710
AB  - Hagfish slime is a unique predator defence material containing a network of long 
      fibrous threads each ∼10 cm in length. Hagfish release the threads in a condensed 
      coiled state known as skeins (∼100 µm), which must unravel within a fraction of a 
      second to thwart a predator attack. Here we consider the hypothesis that viscous 
      hydrodynamics can be responsible for this rapid unravelling, as opposed to chemical 
      reaction kinetics alone. Our main conclusion is that, under reasonable physiological 
      conditions, unravelling due to viscous drag can occur within a few hundred 
      milliseconds, and is accelerated if the skein is pinned at a surface such as the 
      mouth of a predator. We model a single skein unspooling as the fibre peels away due 
      to viscous drag. We capture essential features by considering simplified cases of 
      physiologically relevant flows and one-dimensional scenarios where the fibre is 
      aligned with streamlines in either uniform or uniaxial extensional flow. The peeling 
      resistance is modelled with a power-law dependence on peeling velocity. A 
      dimensionless ratio of viscous drag to peeling resistance appears in the dynamical 
      equations and determines the unraveling time scale. Our modelling approach is 
      general and can be refined with future experimental measurements of peel strength 
      for skein unravelling. It provides key insights into the unravelling process, offers 
      potential answers to lingering questions about slime formation from threads and 
      mucous vesicles, and will aid the growing interest in engineering similar 
      bioinspired material systems.

AB  - The baggy skins of hagfishes confer whole-body flexibility that enables these 
      animals to tie themselves into knots without injury. The skin's looseness is 
      produced by a subcutaneous blood sinus that decouples the skin and body core and 
      permits the core to contort dramatically without loading the skin in tension or 
      shear. Hagfish skin represents a biological composite material comparable in 
      strength and stiffness to the conventionally taut skins of other fishes. However, 
      our understanding of hagfish skin is restricted to only one of 78 species: The 
      Pacific hagfish Eptatretus stoutii. To determine if other hagfish share similar 
      characteristics with E. stoutii, we measured material properties and compared 
      histological data sets from the skins of four hagfish species: E. springeri, E. 
      stoutii, Myxine glutinosa, and M. hubbsi. We also compared these material properties 
      data with skins from the American eel, Anguilla rostrata. We subjected skin samples 
      from all species to uniaxial tensile tests in order to measure strength, stiffness, 
      extensibility, and toughness of skins stretched along longitudinal and 
      circumferential axes. We also used a series of equibiaxial tensile tests on skin 
      samples from E. stoutii, M. glutinosa, and A. rostrata to measure stiffness of skins 
      simultaneously strained along both axes. Significant results of uniaxial and biaxial 
      tests show that the skins from Eptatretus are anisotropic, being stiffer in the 
      longitudinal axis, and more extensible than the isotropic skins of Myxine. Skins of 
      A. rostrata were stiffer in the circumferential axis and they were stronger, 
      tougher, and stiffer than all hagfish skins examined. The skins of Eptatretus are 
      histologically distinct from Myxine skins and possess arrays of fibers that stain 
      like muscle. These interspecific differences across hagfish skins show a 
      phylogenetic pattern with knotting kinematics and flexibility; both genera belong to 
      distinct but major subfamilies within the Myxinidae, and Eptatretus is known for 
      creating and manipulating a greater diversity of knotting styles than Myxine.

AB  - The pituitary gland is present in all vertebrates, from agnathans (jawless fishes) 
      to mammals, but not in invertebrates. Hagfishes, which lack both jaws and vertebrae, 
      are considered the most primitive vertebrate known, living or extinct. Accordingly, 
      studies on hagfishes are indispensable for understanding the origin and evolution of 
      the pituitary hormones. Nevertheless, little is known about the hagfish 
      adenohypophysial hormones. Our recent immunohistochemical and lectin histochemical 
      studies have revealed that gonadotropin (GTH), adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), and 
      growth hormone (GH) are present in the hagfish pituitary gland. This review 
      summarizes the latest data regarding the hagfish adenohypophysial hormones from an 
      evolutionary point of view.

AB  - The hagfishes provide valuable insight into the physiology of feeding, digestion and 
      nutrient absorption by virtue of unusual and unique features of their biology. For 
      example, members of this group undergo long periods of fasting, and are the only 
      vertebrates known to absorb organic nutrients across their epidermal surface. Such 
      properties engender significant attention from researchers interested in feeding and 
      feeding-related processes; however, the practical realities of employing the hagfish 
      as an experimental organism can be challenging. Many of the key tools of the 
      experimental biologist are compromised by a species that does not readily feed in 
      captivity, is difficult to instrument and which produces copious quantities of 
      slime. This Commentary provides critical insight into the key aspects of hagfish 
      feeding and digestive processes, and highlights the pitfalls of this group as 
      experimental organisms. We also suggest key research gaps that, if filled, will lead 
      to better understanding of hagfishes, and we consider how this group may advance our 
      knowledge of feeding, digestion and nutrient absorption processes.

TI  - Glycoprotein hormone in the pituitary of hagfish and its evolutionary implications.
PG  - 75-83

AB  - The pituitary gland is present in all vertebrates, from agnathans (jawless 
      vertebrates) to mammals, but not in invertebrates. Reproduction in gnathostomes 
      (jawed vertebrates) is controlled by two pituitary gonadotropins (GTHs), luteinizing 
      hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, which are part of the pituitary 
      glycoprotein hormone (GPH) family. Hagfishes, which lack both jaws and vertebrae, 
      are considered the most primitive vertebrate known, living or extinct. Accordingly, 
      they are of particular importance in understanding the evolution of the pituitary 
      GPHs and their functions related to vertebrate reproduction. Nevertheless, key 
      elements of the reproductive endocrine system in hagfish have yet to be elucidated. 
      Our current report has revealed the first identification of a functional GPH 
      composed of two subunits that possess gonadotropic action at the pituitary of brown 
      hagfish. It seems most likely that an ancestral GPH gave rise to only one GTH in 
      hagfish pituitary and that multiplicity of GPHs arose later during the early 
      evolution of gnathostomes. This paper briefly summarizes the latest findings on the 
      hagfish GPH from an evolutionary point of view.

AB  - Hagfishes thwart attacks by fish predators by producing liters of defensive slime. 
      The slime is produced when slime gland exudate is released into the predator's 
      mouth, where it deploys in a fraction of a second and clogs the gills. Slime exudate 
      is composed mainly of secretory products from two cell types, gland mucous cells and 
      gland thread cells, which produce the mucous and fibrous components of the slime, 
      respectively. Here, we review what is known about the composition of the slime, 
      morphology of the slime gland, and physiology of the cells that produce the slime. 
      We also discuss several of the mechanisms involved in the deployment of both mucous 
      and thread cells during the transition from thick glandular exudate to ultradilute 
      material. We review biomechanical aspects of the slime, along with recent efforts to 
      produce biomimetic slime thread analogs, and end with a discussion of how hagfish 
      slime may have evolved.

LID - 10.2108/zsj.25.955 [doi]
AB  - Abstract The ParaHox genes comprise three Hox-related homeobox gene families, found 
      throughout the animals. They were first discovered in the invertebrate chordate 
      amphioxus, where they are tightly clustered. In this paper we carry out a 
      comparative review of ParaHox gene cluster organization among the deuterostomes, and 
      discuss how the recently published hagfish ParaHox clusters fit into current 
      theories about the evolution of this group of genes.

TI  - Evolution of the Vertebrate Cranium: Viewed from Hagfish Developmental Studies.
PG  - 229-38
LID - 10.2108/zs150187 [doi]
AB  - Our knowledge of vertebrate cranium evolution has relied largely on the study of 
      gnathostomes. Recent evolutionary and developmental studies of cyclostomes have shed 
      new light on the history of the vertebrate skull. The recent ability to obtain 
      embryos of the hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri, has enabled new studies which have 
      suggested an embryonic morphological pattern (the "cyclostome pattern") of 
      craniofacial development. This pattern is shared by cyclostomes, but not by modern 
      jawed vertebrates. Because this pattern of embryonic head development is thought to 
      be present in some stem gnathostomes (ostracoderms), it is possible that the 
      cyclostome pattern represents the vertebrate ancestral pattern. The study of 
      cyclostomes may thus lead to an understanding of the most ancestral basis of 
      craniofacial development. In this review, we summarize the development of the 
      hagfish chondrocranium in light of the cyclostome pattern, present an updated 
      comparison of the cyclostome chondrocranium, and discuss several aspects of the 
      evolution and development of the vertebrate skull.

TI  - Evolutionary analysis of "hagfish amelogenin".
PG  - 608-11
AB  - Hagfishes lack mineralized tissues and teeth. Part of a cDNA strand, allegedly from 
      amelogenin, the major gene involved in enamel formation in mammals, has recently 
      been cloned in a hagfish (Slavkin and Diekwish, Anat. Rec., 1996;245:131-150). This 
      cloning is of great interest because it could change the current view about the 
      evolution of mineralized tissues, but no phylogenetic analysis of this piece of DNA 
      has been made by the authors. Phylogenetic analysis of this part of cDNA has been 
      conducted using both phenetic and cladistic methods. The cDNA amplified in hagfish 
      does not fit with a nonmammalian origin but fits well with a degraded rodent 
      sequence. The gene cloned in hagfish is probably of mammalian origin due to 
      contamination during PCR.

TI  - Evolutionary crossroads in developmental biology: cyclostomes (lamprey and hagfish).
PG  - 2091-9
LID - 10.1242/dev.074716 [doi]
AB  - Lampreys and hagfish, which together are known as the cyclostomes or 'agnathans', 
      are the only surviving lineages of jawless fish. They diverged early in vertebrate 
      evolution, before the origin of the hinged jaws that are characteristic of 
      gnathostome (jawed) vertebrates and before the evolution of paired appendages. 
      However, they do share numerous characteristics with jawed vertebrates. Studies of 
      cyclostome development can thus help us to understand when, and how, key aspects of 
      the vertebrate body evolved. Here, we summarise the development of cyclostomes, 
      highlighting the key species studied and experimental methods available. We then 
      discuss how studies of cyclostomes have provided important insight into the 
      evolution of fins, jaws, skeleton and neural crest.

TI  - Hagfish Houdinis: biomechanics and behavior of squeezing through small openings.
PG  - 822-827
LID - 10.1242/jeb.151233 [doi]
AB  - Hagfishes are able to squeeze through small openings to gain entry to crevices, 
      burrows, hagfish traps and carcasses, but little is known about how they do this, or 
      what the limits of this ability are. The purpose of this study was to describe this 
      ability, and to investigate possible mechanisms by which it is accomplished. We 
      investigated the hypothesis that the passive movement of blood within a hagfish's 
      flaccid subcutaneous sinus allows it to squeeze through narrow apertures that it 
      would not be able to if it were turgid. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed videos 
      of Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) and Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii) 
      moving through narrow apertures in the lab. We measured changes in body width as the 
      animals moved through these openings and documented the behaviors associated with 
      this ability. We found that hagfishes are able to pass through narrow slits that are 
      less than one half the width of their bodies. Our results are consistent with the 
      idea that a flaccid subcutaneous sinus allows hagfish to squeeze through narrow 
      apertures by facilitating a rapid redistribution of venous blood. In addition, we 
      describe nine distinct behaviors associated with this ability, including a form of 
      non-undulatory locomotion also seen in snakes and lampreys. Our results illuminate a 
      behavior that may be a critical component of the hagfish niche, as a result of its 
      likely importance in feeding and avoiding predators.

TI  - Hagfish from the Cretaceous Tethys Sea and a reconciliation of the 
      morphological-molecular conflict in early vertebrate phylogeny.
PG  - 2146-2151
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1814794116 [doi]
AB  - Hagfish depart so much from other fishes anatomically that they were sometimes 
      considered not fully vertebrate. They may represent: (i) an anatomically primitive 
      outgroup of vertebrates (the morphology-based craniate hypothesis); or (ii) an 
      anatomically degenerate vertebrate lineage sister to lampreys (the molecular-based 
      cyclostome hypothesis). This systematic conundrum has become a prominent case of 
      conflict between morphology- and molecular-based phylogenies. To date, the fossil 
      record has offered few insights to this long-branch problem or the evolutionary 
      history of hagfish in general, because unequivocal fossil members of the group are 
      unknown. Here, we report an unequivocal fossil hagfish from the early Late 
      Cretaceous of Lebanon. The soft tissue anatomy includes key attributes of living 
      hagfish: cartilages of barbels, postcranial position of branchial apparatus, and 
      chemical traces of slime glands. This indicates that the suite of characters unique 
      to living hagfish appeared well before Cretaceous times. This new hagfish prompted a 
      reevaluation of morphological characters for interrelationships among jawless 
      vertebrates. By addressing nonindependence of characters, our phylogenetic analyses 
      recovered hagfish and lampreys in a clade of cyclostomes (congruent with the 
      cyclostome hypothesis) using only morphological data. This new phylogeny places the 
      fossil taxon within the hagfish crown group, and resolved other putative fossil 
      cyclostomes to the stem of either hagfish or lamprey crown groups. These results 
      potentially resolve the morphological-molecular conflict at the base of the 
      Vertebrata. Thus, assessment of character nonindependence may help reconcile 
      morphological and molecular inferences for other major discords in animal phylogeny.

TI  - The history of scientific endeavors towards understanding hagfish embryology.
PG  - 403-18
AB  - Due to their curious phylogenetic position and anatomy, hagfishes have attracted the 
      interest of zoologists, especially in the context of vertebrate evolution. 
      Embryological information on these animals is now also needed in the field of 
      evolutionary developmental biology (Evo-Devo), as it is expected to provide hints 
      about the origin of vertebrate traits, whether the hagfishes are an in-or outgroup 
      of vertebrates. This review summarizes the importance of hagfish embryology from a 
      phylogenetic perspective, and the history of attempts to obtain hagfish eggs and 
      embryos. Clearly, the main difficulty associated with these animals is their 
      deep-sea habitat. To circumvent this problem, this review also discusses the future 
      prospects for obtaining embryological material, both from the wild and in the 
      laboratory.

AB  - Modern hagfishes are considered to be the most primitive of the living craniates and 
      along with their close jawless agnathan relative, the lamprey, take us back an 
      astonishing 500 million years to the base of the vertebrate evolutionary tree. The 
      unique osmoconforming strategy of the hagfish, whereby the osmotic constituents of 
      the blood plasma bear more of a resemblance to marine invertebrates than 
      vertebrates, has been classically depicted in comparative physiology textbooks for 
      many years. Fifty years ago in this journal, Bellamy and Chester Jones [Bellamy and 
      Chester Jones, 1961. CBP 3, 173-183] published a paper on the chemical composition 
      of the tissues of the Atlantic hagfish, Myxine glutinosa. This publication was one 
      of a flurry of papers published in the 50s, 60s and early 70s focused on describing 
      the ionic and osmotic components of this bizarre fish. Here we take a retrospective 
      look at the research that has taken place on these intriguing animals prior to and 
      following the Bellamy and Chester Jones manuscript, focusing on tissue chemical 
      compositions, the possible role of amino acids, and our current view on ion 
      regulation, metabolism and hypoxia tolerance.

AB  - Hagfish eyes are markedly basic compared to the eyes of other vertebrates, lacking a 
      pigmented epithelium, a lens and a retinal architecture built of three cell layers: 
      the photoreceptors, interneurons and ganglion cells. Concomitant with hagfish 
      belonging to the earliest-branching vertebrate group (the jawless Agnathans), this 
      lack of derived characters has prompted competing interpretations that hagfish eyes 
      represent either a transitional form in the early evolution of vertebrate vision, or 
      a regression from a previously elaborate organ. Here, we show the hagfish retina is 
      not extensively degenerating during its ontogeny, but instead grows throughout life 
      via a recognizable PAX6+ ciliary marginal zone. The retina has a distinct layer of 
      photoreceptor cells that appear to homogeneously express a single opsin of the RH1 
      rod opsin class. The epithelium that encompasses these photoreceptors is striking 
      because it lacks the melanin pigment that is universally associated with animal 
      vision; notwithstanding, we suggest this epithelium is a homologue of gnathosome 
      retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) based on its robust expression of RPE65 and its 
      engulfment of photoreceptor outer segments. We infer that the hagfish retina is not 
      entirely rudimentary in its wiring, despite lacking a morphologically distinct layer 
      of interneurons: multiple populations of cells exist in the hagfish inner retina and 
      subsets of these express markers of vertebrate retinal interneurons. Overall, these 
      data clarify Agnathan retinal homologies, reveal characters that now appear to be 
      ubiquitous across the eyes of vertebrates, and refine interpretations of early 
      vertebrate visual system evolution.

TI  - Unraveling inter-species differences in hagfish slime skein deployment.
LID - jeb176925 [pii]
LID - 10.1242/jeb.176925 [doi]
AB  - Hagfishes defend themselves from fish predators by producing defensive slime 
      consisting of mucous and thread components that interact synergistically with 
      seawater to pose a suffocation risk to their attackers. Deployment of the slime 
      occurs in a fraction of a second and involves hydration of mucous vesicles as well 
      as unraveling of the coiled threads to their full length of ∼150 mm. Previous work 
      showed that unraveling of coiled threads (or 'skeins') in Atlantic hagfish requires 
      vigorous mixing with seawater as well as the presence of mucus, whereas skeins from 
      Pacific hagfish tend to unravel spontaneously in seawater. Here, we explored the 
      mechanisms that underlie these different unraveling modes, and focused on the 
      molecules that make up the skein glue, a material that must be disrupted for 
      unraveling to proceed. We found that Atlantic hagfish skeins are also held together 
      with a protein glue, but compared with Pacific hagfish glue, it is less soluble in 
      seawater. Using SDS-PAGE, we identified several soluble proteins and glycoproteins 
      that are liberated from skeins under conditions that drive unraveling in vitro 
      Peptides generated by mass spectrometry of five of these proteins and glycoproteins 
      mapped strongly to 14 sequences assembled from Pacific hagfish slime gland 
      transcriptomes, with all but one of these sequences possessing homologs in the 
      Atlantic hagfish. Two of these sequences encode unusual acidic proteins that we 
      propose are the structural glycoproteins that make up the skein glue. These 
      sequences have no known homologs in other species and are likely to be unique to 
      hagfishes. Although the ecological significance of the two modes of skein unraveling 
      described here are unknown, they may reflect differences in predation pressure, with 
      selection for faster skein unraveling in the Eptatretus lineage leading to the 
      evolution of a glue that is more soluble.

LID - 30371
AB  - When hagfish (Myxinidae) are attacked by predators, they form a dilute, elastic, and 
      cohesive defensive slime made of mucins and protein threads. In this study we 
      propose a link between flow behavior and defense mechanism of hagfish slime. 
      Oscillatory rheological measurements reveal that hagfish slime forms viscoelastic 
      networks at low concentrations. Mucins alone did not contribute viscoelasticity, 
      however in shear flow, viscosity was observed. The unidirectional flow, experienced 
      by hagfish slime during suction feeding by predators, was mimicked with extensional 
      rheology. Elongational stresses were found to increase mucin viscosity. The 
      resulting higher resistance to flow could support clogging of the attacker's gills. 
      Shear flow in contrast decreases the slime viscosity by mucin aggregation and leads 
      to a collapse of the slime network. Hagfish may benefit from this collapse when 
      trapped in their own slime and facing suffocation by tying a sliding knot with their 
      body to shear off the slime. This removal could be facilitated by the apparent shear 
      thinning behavior of the slime. Therefore hagfish slime, thickening in elongation 
      and thinning in shear, presents a sophisticated natural high water content gel with 
      flow properties that may be beneficial for both, defense and escape.

TI  - Structure and dynamics of hagfish mucin in different saline environments.
PG  - 8627-8637
LID - 10.1039/c9sm00971j [doi]
AB  - The defense mechanism of hagfish against predators is based on its ability to form 
      slime within a few milliseconds. Hagfish slime consists of two main components, 
      namely mucin-like glycoproteins and long protein threads, which together entrap vast 
      amounts of water and thus form a highly dilute hydrogel. Here, we investigate the 
      mucin part of this hydrogel, in particular the role of the saline marine environment 
      on the viscoelasticity and structure. By means of dynamic light scattering (DLS), 
      shear and extensional rheology we probe the diffusion dynamics, the flow behavior, 
      and the longest filament breaking time of hagfish mucin solutions. Using DLS we find 
      a concentration-independent diffusion coefficient - characteristic for 
      polyelectrolytes - up to the entanglement regime of 0.2 mg ml-1, which is about ten 
      times higher than the natural concentration of hagfish mucin in hagfish slime. We 
      also observe a slow relaxation process associated with clustering, probably due to 
      electrostatic interactions. Shear rheology further revealed that hagfish mucin 
      possesses pronounced viscoelastic properties at high concentrations (3 mg ml-1), 
      showing that mucin alone achieves mechanical properties similar to those of natural 
      hagfish slime (mucins and protein threads). The main effects of added seawater 
      salts, and predominantly CaCl2 is to reduce the intensity of the slow relaxation 
      process, which suggests that calcium ions lead to an ionotropic gelation of hagfish 
      mucins.

AB  - Hagfishes may encounter low dissolved oxygen in their natural habitats, a 
      consequence of association with hypoxic sediments and their feeding behaviour. In 
      teleost fish, hypoxia exposure decreases ion uptake, speculated to be a mechanism 
      for energy conservation. Although hagfishes osmoconform, they do regulate 
      extracellular fluid concentrations of divalent cations such as calcium. The current 
      study hypothesised that exposure of hagfish to hypoxia (0.4 kPA, 24 h) would reduce 
      calcium uptake (determined via in vitro isolated skin and gut epithelial transport 
      assays) and calcium accumulation (determined by in vivo whole animal exposures, 
      using radiolabelled calcium ((45)Ca) to assess newly acquired calcium). A decrease 
      in in vitro epidermal uptake was observed at sub-environmental calcium levels 
      (10 μM), but not at environmental calcium levels (10 mM). No changes in gut calcium 
      uptake were determined. Conversely, hypoxia led to a more rapid in vivo accumulation 
      of calcium in tissues (skin, muscle, liver, heart, plasma, brain), mediated mostly 
      by a significant increase in accumulation at the gill. These differences were only 
      apparent after 1-h of exposure to the radiolabel (i.e., the last hour of the 24-h 
      hypoxia exposure) and were not observed after 3 and 24 h periods of radiolabel 
      exposure. This outcome was the opposite of the hypothesised effect. The reasons for 
      a more rapid accumulation of calcium in hypoxic hagfish are unknown but may relate 
      to roles for calcium in enhancing hypoxia tolerance in hagfishes or could be a 
      consequence of changes in ventilatory frequency.

AB  - The reproductive biology of Pacific hagfish Eptatretus stoutii (Lockington, 1878) 
      and black hagfish Eptatretus deani (Evermann & Goldsborough, 1907) was assessed 
      using current and historical data. Our results found that the reproductive 
      characteristics of both hagfish species reflect those of K-selected species, which 
      tend to live long and exhibit slow growth rates, low fecundity (approximately 20 
      eggs per female) and late maturity. Additionally, females of both species commence 
      maturation prior to males. This study provides a population profile for both species 
      of hagfish, but further assessments are needed to effectively manage a sustainable 
      hagfish fishery.

AB  - In dissecting the transition from invertebrates to vertebrates at the molecular 
      level, whole-genome duplications are recognized as a key event. This gave rise to 
      more copies of genes in jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes), such as the four Hox 
      clusters in the human, compared to the single ancestral cluster in invertebrates. To 
      date, as the most early-branching lineages in vertebrates, cyclostomes (hagfishes 
      and lampreys) have been used for comparative analyses of gene regulations and 
      functions. However, assignment of orthology/paralogy for cyclostomes' genes is not 
      unambiguously demonstrated. Thus, there is a high degree of incongruence in tree 
      topologies between gene families, although whole genome duplications postulate 
      uniform patterns in gene phylogeny. In this review, we demonstrate how expansion of 
      an ancient genome before the cyclostome-gnathostome split, followed by reciprocal 
      gene loss, can cause this incongruence. This is sometimes referred to as 'hidden 
      paralogy'.

AB  - The defense mechanism of hagfish slime is remarkable considering that hagfish cannot 
      control the concentration of the resulting gel directly; they simply exude a 
      concentrated material into a comparably "infinite" sea of water to form a dilute, 
      sticky, cohesive elastic gel. This raises questions about the robustness of gel 
      formation and rheological properties across a range of concentrations, which we 
      study here for the first time. Across a nearly 100-fold change in concentration, we 
      discover that the gel has similar viscoelastic time-dependent properties with 
      constant power-law exponent (α=0.18±0.01), constant relative damping 
      tanδ=G('')/G(')≈0.2-0.3, and varying overall stiffness that scales linearly with the 
      concentration (∼c(0.99±0.05)). The power-law viscoelasticity (fit by a fractional 
      Kelvin-Voigt model) is persistent at all concentrations with nearly constant fractal 
      dimension. This is unlike other materials and suggests that the underlying material 
      structure of slime remains self-similar irrespective of concentration. This 
      interpretation is consistent with our microscopy studies of the fiber network. We 
      derive a structure-rheology model to test the hypothesis that the origins of 
      ultra-soft elasticity are based on bending of the fibers. The model predictions show 
      an excellent agreement with the experiments. Our findings illustrate the unusual and 
      robust properties of slime which may be vital in its physiological use and provide 
      inspiration for the design of new engineered materials. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: 
      Hagfish produce a unique gel-like material to defend themselves against predator 
      attacks. The successful use of the defense gel is remarkable considering that 
      hagfish cannot control the concentration of the resulting gel directly; they simply 
      exude a small quantity of biomaterial which then expands by a factor of 10,000 (by 
      volume) into an "infinite" sea of water. This raises questions about the robustness 
      of gel formation and properties across a range of concentrations. This study 
      provides the first ever understanding of the mechanics of hagfish slime over a very 
      wide range of concentration. We discover that some viscoelastic properties of slime 
      are remarkably constant regardless of its concentration. Such a characteristic is 
      uncommon in most known materials.

AB  - The efficacy of three common fish anesthetics (clove oil, 2-phenoxyethanol, and 
      tricaine methanesulfonate) was evaluated in the Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus 
      stoutii). The overarching aim of our study was to identify the best anesthetic and 
      concentration for the purposes of routine laboratory use of Pacific hagfish (i.e., 
      short and consistent induction and recovery times and minimized stress and safety 
      risk to hagfish). The objectives of our study were fourfold: (1) identify anesthetic 
      stages of Pacific hagfish using clove oil anesthesia; (2) establish standardized 
      anesthesia preparation procedures; (3) determine the optimal anesthetic and 
      concentration for safely achieving stage V anesthesia; and (4) investigate the 
      effects of repeatedly exposing Pacific hagfish to anesthesia. Experimental 
      concentrations, ranging from 50 to 400 mg/L, of each anesthetic were tested on at 
      least three Pacific hagfish individuals. We found the following: (1) Pacific hagfish 
      exhibited similar stages of anesthesia to those described for bony fishes; (2) 
      sufficient mixing of clove oil with seawater had a considerable effect on the 
      consistency and timing of anesthetic induction; (3) concentration and anesthetic 
      significantly impacted induction and recovery timing, whereas body mass had no 
      impact on anesthetic trends; and (4) repeatedly exposing Pacific hagfish to optimal 
      concentrations of clove oil or MS-222 had no effect on induction or recovery timing, 
      whereas exposure number significantly impacted induction timing when using 2-PE. Due 
      to consistent induction and recovery times, low risk of accidental overdose, and 
      high safety margins for both handler and hagfish, we recommend 175 mg/L of clove oil 
      as the ideal anesthetic and concentration for the routine laboratory use of Pacific 
      hagfish.

AB  - One or more distinct forms of the nuclear estrogen receptor (ER) have been isolated 
      from many vertebrates to date. To better understand the molecular evolution of ERs, 
      we cloned and characterized er cDNAs from the inshore hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri, a 
      modern representative of the most primitive vertebrates, the agnathans. Two er 
      cDNAs, er1 and er2, were isolated from the liver of a reproductive female hagfish. A 
      phylogenetic analysis placed hagfish ER1 into a position prior to the divergence of 
      vertebrate ERs. Conversely, hagfish ER2 was placed at the base of the vertebrate ERβ 
      clade. The tissue distribution patterns of both ER subtype mRNAs appeared to be 
      different, suggesting that each subtype has different physiological roles associated 
      with estrogen actions. An estrogen responsive-luciferase reporter assay using 
      mammalian HEK293 cells was used to functionally characterize these hagfish ERs. Both 
      ER proteins displayed estrogen-dependent activation of transcription. These results 
      clearly demonstrate that the hagfish has two functional ER subtypes.

AB  - Hagfish are the most primitive craniates and scavengers, feeding on dead organisms 
      as well as fish and invertebrates. Hagfish play an important ecological role in 
      recycling nutrients, helping to recycle biomass from the upper water column. We 
      investigated 265 specimens of four hagfish species, including Eptatretus burgeri, 
      Eptatretus yangi, Eptatretus sheni and Eptatretus taiwanae from northeastern 
      Taiwanese waters of the northwestern Pacific from November 2013 to June 2014. Eight 
      species of Anisakid nematodes were identified: Anisakis pegreffii, Anisakis simplex 
      s.s., a recombinant genotype of A. pegreffii and A. simplex s.s., Anisakis typica, 
      Anisakis sp., Anisakis brevispiculata, Anisakis physeteris and Hysterothylacium 
      amoyense. Anisakis sp. and H. amoyense represented new locality records. The 
      prevalence, mean intensity and mean abundance of anisakid nematodes for all 
      specimens were 21.51%, 5.39 larvae per fish and 1.16 larvae per fish, respectively. 
      A. pegreffii was the most frequent species in E. burgeri, E. yangi and E. taiwanae, 
      whereas in E. sheni, the dominant species was Anisakis sp. The number of nematodes 
      was significantly related to the host length for E. burgeri and E. sheni, but was 
      not related to the sex of the four hagfish species. This report of scavenging 
      hagfish infected with Anisakid larvae suggests hagfish as a transport/paratenic host 
      between cetaceans and piscivores. Anisakiasis may be caused by the consumption of 
      infectious third-stage larvae in raw or undercooked hagfish.

AB  - Stiff fibers are used as reinforcing phases in a wide range of high-performance 
      composite materials. Silk is one of the most widely studied bio-fibers, but 
      alternative materials with specific advantages are also being explored. Among these, 
      native hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii) slime thread is an attractive protein-based 
      polymer. These threads consist of coiled-coil intermediate filaments (IFs) as 
      nano-scale building blocks, which can be transformed into extended 
      β-sheet-containing chains upon draw-processing, resulting in fibers with impressive 
      mechanical performance. Here, we report artificial hagfish threads produced by 
      recombinant protein expression, which were subsequently self-assembled into 
      coiled-coil nanofilaments, concentrated, and processed into β-sheet-rich fibers by a 
      "picking-up" method. These artificial fibers experienced mechanical performance 
      enhancement during draw-processing. We exploited the lysine content to covalently 
      cross-link the draw-processed fibers and obtained moduli values (E) in tension as 
      high as ∼20 GPa, which is stiffer than most reported artificial proteinaceous 
      materials.

TI  - The ventilation mechanism of the Pacific hagfish Eptatretus stoutii.
PG  - 261-276
LID - 10.1111/jfb.13885 [doi]
AB  - We made anatomical and physiological observations of the breathing mechanisms in 
      Pacific hagfish Eptatretus stoutii, with measurements of nostril flow and pressure, 
      mouth and pharyngo-cutaneous duct (PCD) pressure and velum and heart impedance and 
      observations of dye flow patterns. Resting animals frequently exhibit spontaneous 
      apnea. During normal breathing, water flow is continuous at a high rate 
      (~125 ml kg(-1) min(-1) at 12°C) powered by a two-phase unidirectional pumping 
      system with a fast suction pump (the velum, ~22 min(-1) ) for inhalation through the 
      single nostril and a much slower force pump (gill pouches and PCD ~4.4 min(-1) ) for 
      exhalation. The mouth joins the pharynx posterior to the velum and plays no role in 
      ventilation at rest or during swimming. Increases in flow up to >400 ml kg(-1) 
      min(-1) can be achieved by increases in both velum frequency and stroke volume and 
      the ventilatory index (product of frequency x nostril pressure amplitude) provides a 
      useful proxy for ventilatory flow rate. Two types of coughing (flow reversals) are 
      described. During spontaneous swimming, ventilatory pressure and flow pulsatility 
      becomes synchronised with rhythmic body undulations.

AB  - The suitability of a traditional testing paradigm (e.g. choice chamber) for 
      assessing chemosensory behaviour in the Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii, was 
      examined. Actively-swimming hagfish, tested at night, showed no preference for any 
      region of a T-maze in the absence of a stimulus, but in the presence of an olfactory 
      food cue, spent significantly more time in the zone where the cue was placed. 
      Conversely, hagfish avoided spending time in the zone the fish anaesthetic 3-amino 
      benzoic acid ethylester (MS-222) was placed, and demonstrated significantly more 
      reversal responses in which the fish moved its body backwards. These data suggest 
      that hagfish are an amenable model species for laboratory testing of behaviour.

TI  - The use of Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) as a bioindicator species for studies 
      on effects of dumped chemical warfare agents in the Skagerrak. 2. Biochemical 
      biomarkers.

AB  - The sea bottom of the Skagerrak Strait (North Sea) contains munitions loaded with 
      chemical warfare agents (CWA), mostly stored in shipwrecks scuttled intentionally 
      after the end of the World War II. The munition shells inside the wrecks are in 
      different states of deterioration and corrosion and their environmental risk 
      potential is unknown. The Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa), a sediment-dwelling 
      chordate, was used as a model organism to study the potential impact of dumped CWA 
      on the local ecosystem by using biochemical biomarkers. The hagfish were collected 
      in 2017 and 2018 at three sampling sites: in the immediate vicinity of a wreck with 
      CWA in the Skagerrak, a few kilometres from the wreck, and a reference site 21 km 
      from the wreck, considered to be free of CWA. Significant differences were observed 
      between the wreck site and the reference sites in the activities of glutathione 
      reductase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione S-transferase, while the activity 
      levels of catalase and acetylcholinesterase were identical at all sites. The 
      recorded differences demonstrated negative biological effects in the hagfish sampled 
      close to the dumped chemical munitions. Due to the limited knowledge of hagfish 
      biology and of the extent of CWA contamination in Skagerrak, the results presented 
      here warrant more research to further elucidate the potential environmental risks of 
      the scuttled wrecks. The usefulness of the species as a bioindicator organism is 
      further discussed.

TI  - Drinking and water permeability in the Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii.
PG  - 1127-1135
LID - 10.1007/s00360-017-1097-2 [doi]
AB  - Hagfish are osmoconformers, maintaining an internal osmolality that matches their 
      seawater habitats. Hagfish would, therefore, appear to have no physiological need to 
      drink, but previous studies are equivocal regarding whether drinking in hagfish 
      occurs. The current study addressed this knowledge gap, by examining drinking and 
      water permeability in the Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii. One-third of analysed 
      hagfish were shown to accumulate radiolabelled drinking rate markers (tritiated 
      inulin and polyethylene glycol-4000) in their gut tissues; however, this was 
      attributed to the presence of markers in the blood perfusing the digestive tract, 
      following absorption through paracellular pathways at the gill. No accumulation of 
      marker was observed in hagfish subjected to more dilute (75% seawater) or more 
      concentrated (125% seawater) media. Diffusive water efflux, measured by tritiated 
      water washout, was shown to be very high, with 50% of body water exchanged within 14 
      to 16 min, depending on exposure salinity. In full-strength seawater, the total 
      exchangeable pool of water was 78% of hagfish mass. We conclude that hagfish do not 
      drink, and their high water permeability is likely to result in rapid osmotic 
      equilibration under circumstances where perturbations may occur.

TI  - Hagfish embryology with reference to the evolution of the neural crest.
PG  - 672-5
AB  - Hagfish, which lack both jaws and vertebrae, have long been the subject of intense 
      interest owing to their position at a crucial point in the evolutionary transition 
      to a truly vertebrate body plan. However, unlike the comparatively well 
      characterized vertebrate agnathan lamprey, little is known about hagfish 
      development. The inability to analyse hagfish at early embryonic stages has 
      frustrated attempts to resolve questions with important phylogenetic implications, 
      including fundamental ones relating to the emergence of the neural crest. Here we 
      report the obtainment of multiple pharyngula-stage embryos of the hagfish species 
      Eptatretus burgeri and our preliminary analyses of their early development. We 
      present histological evidence of putative neural crest cells, which appear as 
      delaminated cells that migrate along pathways corresponding to neural crest cells in 
      fish and amphibians. Molecular cloning studies further revealed the expression of 
      several regulatory genes, including cognates of Pax6, Pax3/7, SoxEa and Sox9, 
      suggesting that the hagfish neural crest is specified by molecular mechanisms that 
      are general to vertebrates. We propose that the neural crest emerged as a population 
      of de-epithelialized migratory cells in a common vertebrate ancestor, and suggest 
      that the possibility of classical and molecular embryology in hagfish opens up new 
      approaches to clarifying the evolutionary history of vertebrates.

TI  - Hagfish and lamprey Hox genes reveal conservation of temporal colinearity in 
      vertebrates.
PG  - 859-866
LID - 10.1038/s41559-018-0526-2 [doi]
AB  - Hox genes exert fundamental roles for proper regional specification along the main 
      rostro-caudal axis of animal embryos. They are generally expressed in restricted 
      spatial domains according to their position in the cluster (spatial colinearity)-a 
      feature that is conserved across bilaterians. In jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes), 
      the position in the cluster also determines the onset of expression of Hox genes (a 
      feature known as whole-cluster temporal colinearity (WTC)), while in invertebrates 
      this phenomenon is displayed as a subcluster-level temporal colinearity. However, 
      little is known about the expression profile of Hox genes in jawless vertebrates 
      (cyclostomes); therefore, the evolutionary origin of WTC, as seen in gnathostomes, 
      remains a mystery. Here, we show that Hox genes in cyclostomes are expressed 
      according to WTC during development. We investigated the Hox repertoire and Hox gene 
      expression profiles in three different species-a hagfish, a lamprey and a 
      shark-encompassing the two major groups of vertebrates, and found that these are 
      expressed following a whole-cluster, temporally staggered pattern, indicating that 
      WTC has been conserved during the past 500 million years despite drastically 
      different genome evolution and morphological outputs between jawless and jawed 
      vertebrates.

TI  - Non-parsimonious evolution of hagfish Dlx genes.
PG  - 15
LID - 10.1186/1471-2148-13-15 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of members of the Dlx gene family increased during the two 
      rounds of whole-genome duplication that occurred in the common ancestor of the 
      vertebrates. Because the Dlx genes are involved in the development of the cranial 
      skeleton, brain, and sensory organs, their expression patterns have been analysed in 
      various organisms in the context of evolutionary developmental biology. Six Dlx 
      genes have been isolated in the lampreys, a group of living jawless vertebrates 
      (cyclostomes), and their expression patterns analysed. However, little is known 
      about the Dlx genes in the hagfish, the other cyclostome group, mainly because the 
      embryological analysis of this animal is difficult. RESULTS: To identify the hagfish 
      Dlx genes and describe their expression patterns, we cloned the cDNA from embryos of 
      the Japanese inshore hagfish Eptatretus burgeri. Our results show that the hagfish 
      has at least six Dlx genes and one pseudogene. In a phylogenetic analysis, the 
      hagfish Dlx genes and those of the lampreys tended to be excluded from the clade of 
      the gnathostome Dlx genes. In several cases, the lamprey Dlx genes clustered with 
      the clade consisting of two hagfish genes, suggesting that independent gene 
      duplications have occurred in the hagfish lineage. Analysis of the expression of 
      these genes showed distinctive overlapping expression patterns in the cranial 
      mesenchymal cells and the inner ear. CONCLUSIONS: Independent duplication, 
      pseudogenization, and loss of the Dlx genes probably occurred in the hagfish lineage 
      after its split from the other vertebrate lineages. This pattern is reminiscent of 
      the non-parsimonious evolution of its morphological traits, including its inner ear 
      and vertebrae, which indicate that this group is an early-branching lineage that 
      diverged before those characters evolved.

TI  - Hagfish intestinal antimicrobial peptides are ancient cathelicidins.
PG  - 1655-67
AB  - Three potent broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptides (HFIAP-1, -2, and -3) isolated 
      from intestinal tissues of Myxine glutinosa (Atlantic hagfish) are identified as 
      ancient members of the cathelicidin family of antimicrobial peptides, hitherto known 
      only from mammals. In situ hybridization reveals that HFIAPs are produced in nests 
      of myeloid cells within the loose connective tissue of the gut wall, a tissue 
      reminiscent of both gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and vertebrate spleen. We 
      suggest that this tissue organization provides local defense of the hagfish 
      gastrointestinal tract via innate immunity and possibly served as the architectural 
      plan upon which the adaptive immune system evolved.

TI  - The use of Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) as a bioindicator species for studies

AB  - Within the framework of the international project DAIMON (Decision Aid for Marine 
      Munitions), the impact of dumped chemical munitions on fish health was investigated. 
      The Skagerrak Straight (North Sea, at 600 m depth) contains munitions with chemical 
      warfare agents (CWA), scuttled after the end of World War II. Studies of liver 
      histopathology in Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) were carried out at three 
      sampling sites: at a wreck with CWA in the Skagerrak (n = 82), a Skagerrak reference 
      site considered to be free of CWA (n = 14) and at a reference site in the northern 
      North Sea outside the Skagerrak (n = 17). Liver lesions were diagnosed and 
      categorized according to standardized ICES and BEQUALM protocols and OSPAR 
      guidelines. Non-specific liver lesions were found in 87.6% of 113 hagfish examined. 
      The prevalence of pre-neoplastic lesions was 7.1% and of neoplastic lesions 6.2%. 
      There was no statistically significant difference in prevalence between hagfish 
      samples from the wreck site and from the reference site near the wrecks. However, at 
      the reference site in the northern North Sea, the prevalence of non-specific lesions 
      was low and neither pre-neoplastic nor neoplastic lesions were observed.

      systemic hearts continue to work throughout the exposure. Recent work demonstrates 
      that glycogen stores are utilized in the E. stoutii heart during anoxia but that 
      these are not sufficient to support the measured rate of ATP production. One 
      metabolic fuel that could supplement glycogen during anoxia is glycerol. This 
      substrate can be derived from lipid stores, stored in the heart, or delivered via 
      the blood. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of glycerol on the 
      contractile function of the excised E. stoutii heart during anoxia exposure. When 
      excised hearts, perfused with metabolite free saline (mf-saline), were exposed to 
      anoxia for 12 h, there was no difference in heart rate, pressure generation 
      (max-dP), rate of contraction (max-dP/dt(sys)), or rate of relaxation 
      (max-dP/dt(dia)) compared to hearts perfused with mf-saline in normoxia. However, 
      hearts perfused with saline containing glycerol (gly-saline) in anoxia had higher 
      max-dP, max-dP/dt(sys), and max-dP/dt(dia) than hearts perfused with mf-saline in 
      anoxia. Tissue levels of glycerol increased when hearts were perfused with 
      gly-saline in normoxia, but not when perfused with gly-saline in anoxia. Anoxia 
      exposure did not affect the activities of triglyceride lipase, glycerol kinase, or 
      glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. This study suggests that glycerol stimulates 
      cardiac function in the hagfish but that it is not derived from stored lipids. How 
      glycerol may stimulate contraction is not known. This could be as an energy 
      substrate, as an allosteric factor, or a combination of the two.

TI  - Understanding ventilation and oxygen uptake of Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii),

AB  - The hagfishes are an ancient and evolutionarily important group, with breathing 
      mechanisms and gills very different from those of other fishes. Hagfish inhale 
      through a single nostril via a velum pump, and exhale through multiple separate gill 
      pouches. We assessed respiratory performance in E. stoutii (31 ppt, 12 ºC, 50-120 g) 
      by measuring total ventilatory flow ([Formula: see text]) at the nostril, velar 
      (respiratory) frequency (fr), and inspired (P(I)O(2)) and expired (P(E)O(2)) oxygen 
      tensions at all 12 gill pouch exits plus the pharyngo-cutaneous duct (PCD) on the 
      left side, and calculated ventilatory stroke volume (S[Formula: see text]), % O(2) 
      utilization, and oxygen consumption (ṀO(2)). At rest under normoxia, spontaneous 
      changes in [Formula: see text] ranged from apnea to > 400 ml kg(-1) min(-1), due to 
      variations in both fr and S[Formula: see text]; "normal" [Formula: see text] 
      averaged 137 ml kg(-1) min(-1), ṀO(2) was 718 µmol kg(-1) h(-1), so the ventilatory 
      convection requirement for O(2) was about 11 L mmol(-1). Relative to anterior gill 
      pouches, lower P(E)O(2) values (i.e. higher utilization) occurred in the more 
      posterior pouches and PCD. Overall, O(2) utilization was 34% and did not change 
      during hyperventilation but increased to > 90% during hypoventilation. Environmental 
      hypoxia (P(I)O(2) ~ 8% air saturation, 1.67 kPa, 13 Torr) caused hyperventilation, 
      but neither acute hyperoxia (P(I)O(2) ~ 275% air saturation, 57.6 kPa, 430 Torr) nor 
      hypercapnia (P(I)CO(2) ~ 1% CO(2), 1.0 kPa, 7.5 Torr) significantly altered 
      [Formula: see text]. ṀO(2) decreased in hypoxia and increased in hyperoxia but did 
      not change in hypercapnia. Acute exposure to high environmental ammonia (HEA, 10 mM 
      NH(4)HCO(3)) caused an acute decrease in [Formula: see text], in contrast to the 
      hyperventilation of long-term HEA exposure described in a previous study. The 
      hypoventilatory response to HEA still occurred during hypoxia and hyperoxia, but was 
      blunted during hypercapnia. Under all treatments, ṀO(2) increased with increases in 
      [Formula: see text]. Overall, there were lower convection requirements for O(2) 
      during hyperoxia, higher requirements during hypoxia and hypercapnia, but unchanged 
      requirements during HEA. We conclude that this "primitive" fish operates a flexible 
      respiratory system with considerable reserve capacity.

TI  - Material Properties of Hagfish Skin, with Insights into Knotting Behaviors.
PG  - 243-56
AB  - Hagfishes (Myxinidae) often integrate whole-body knotting movements with jawless 
      biting motions when reducing large marine carcasses to ingestible items. Adaptations 
      for these behaviors include complex arrangements of axial muscles and flexible, 
      elongate bodies without vertebrae. Between the axial muscles and the hagfish skin is 
      a large, blood-filled subcutaneous sinus devoid of the intricate, myoseptal tendon 
      networks characteristic of the taut skins of other fishes. We propose that the 
      loose-fitting skin of the hagfish facilitates the formation and manipulation of body 
      knots, even if it is of little functional significance to steady swimming. Hagfish 
      skin is a relatively thick, anisotropic, multilayered composite material comprising 
      a superficial, thin, and slimy epidermis, a middle dermal layer densely packed with 
      fibrous tissues, and a deep subdermal layer comprised of adipose tissue. Hagfish 
      skin is stiffer when pulled longitudinally than circumferentially. Stress-strain 
      data from uniaxial tensile tests show that hagfish skins are comparable in tensile 
      strength and stiffness to the taut skins of elongate fishes that do not engage in 
      knotting behaviors (e.g., sea lamprey and penpoint gunnel). Sheath-core-constructed 
      ropes, which serve as more accurate models for hagfish bodies, demonstrate that 
      loose skin (extra sheathing) enhances flexibility of the body (rope). Along with a 
      loose-fitting skin, the morphologies of hagfish skin parallel those of moray eels, 
      which are also known for generating and manipulating figure-eight-style body knots 
      when struggling with prey.

TI  - Hagfish slime ecomechanics: testing the gill-clogging hypothesis.
PG  - 702-10
AB  - Hagfish are able to produce substantial amounts of slime when harassed, but the 
      precise ecological function of the slime is unclear. One possibility is that the 
      slime acts as a defence against gill-breathing predators, whose gills may become 
      entangled with the slime's mixture of mucins and fibrous threads during an attack. 
      We previously demonstrated that hagfish slime does not bind water tightly, but 
      instead behaves like a fine sieve that slows water down via viscous entrainment. 
      These properties are consistent with the gill-clogging hypothesis, which we tested 
      here by quantifying the effects of hagfish slime on water flow through an artificial 
      gill model and real fish gills. Our results indicate that the slime is capable of 
      clogging gills and increasing the resistance that they present to the flow of water. 
      We also characterized the behaviour of slime release from live hagfish and the 
      effect of convective mixing on the formation of slime in vitro. Our observations 
      show that exudate is locally released from the slime glands as a coherent jet and 
      that hagfish do not appear to use their slime as a protective envelope. We found 
      that convective mixing between the exudate and seawater is necessary for proper 
      slime formation, but excessive mixing leads to the slime's collapse. We suggest that 
      the loose binding of water by the slime may be an optimal solution to the problem of 
      delivering an expanding jet of flow-inhibiting material to the gills of would-be 
      predators.

PG  - 15013-8
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1314540110 [doi]
AB  - Jawless vertebrates (cyclostomes) have an alternative adaptive immune system in 
      which lymphocytes somatically diversify their variable lymphocyte receptors (VLR) 
      through recombinatorial use of leucine-rich repeat cassettes during VLR gene 
      assembly. Three types of these anticipatory receptors in lampreys (VLRA, VLRB, and 
      VLRC) are expressed by separate lymphocyte lineages. However, only two VLR genes 
      (VLRA and VLRB) have been found in hagfish. Here we have identified a third hagfish 
      VLR, which undergoes somatic assembly to generate sufficient diversity to encode a 
      large repertoire of anticipatory receptors. Sequence analysis, structural 
      comparison, and phylogenetic analysis indicate that the unique hagfish VLR is the 
      counterpart of lamprey VLRA and the previously identified hagfish "VLRA" is the 
      lamprey VLRC counterpart. The demonstration of three orthologous VLR genes in both 
      lampreys and hagfish suggests that this anticipatory receptor system evolved in a 
      common ancestor of the two cyclostome lineages around 480 Mya.

TI  - Hagfish (cyclostomata, vertebrata): searching for the ancestral developmental plan 
      of vertebrates.
PG  - 167-72
LID - 10.1002/bies.20701 [doi]
AB  - The phylogenetic position of the hagfish remains enigmatic. In contrast to molecular 
      data that suggest monophyly of the cyclostomes, several morphological features imply 
      a more ancestral state of this animal compared with the lampreys. To resolve this 
      question requires an understanding of the embryology of the hagfish, especially of 
      the neural crest. The early development of the hagfish has long remained a mystery. 
      We collected a shallow-water-dwelling hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri, set up an 
      aquarium tank designed to resemble its habitat, and successfully obtained several 
      embryos. By observing the histology and expression of genes known to play 
      fundamental roles in the neural crest, we found that the hagfish crest develops as 
      delaminating migratory cells, as in other vertebrates. We conclude that the 
      delaminating neural crest is a vertebrate synapomorphy that seems to have appeared 
      from the beginning of their evolutionary history, before the splitting away of the 
      hagfish lineage.

TI  - The next generation of protein super-fibres: robust recombinant production and 
      recovery of hagfish intermediate filament proteins with fibre spinning and 
      mechanical-structural characterizations.
PG  - 1976-1989
LID - 10.1111/1751-7915.13869 [doi]
AB  - Native hagfish intermediate filament proteins have impressive mechanical properties. 
      However, using these native fibres for any application is impractical, necessitating 
      their recombinant production. In the only literature report on the proteins (denoted 
      α and ɣ), heterologous expression levels, using E. coli, were low and no attempts 
      were made to optimize expression, explore wet-spinning, or spin the two proteins 
      individually into fibres. Reported here is the high production (~8 g l(-1) of dry 
      protein) of the hagfish intermediate filament proteins, with yields orders of 
      magnitude higher (325-1000×) than previous reports. The proteins were spun into 
      fibres individually and in their native-like 1:1 ratio. For all fibres, the hallmark 
      α-helix to β-sheet conversion occurred after draw-processing. The native-like 1:1 
      ratio fibres achieved the highest average tensile strength in this study at nearly 
      200 MPa with an elastic modulus of 5.7 GPa, representing the highest tensile 
      strength reported for these proteins without chemical cross-linking. Interestingly, 
      the recombinant α protein achieved nearly the same mechanical properties when spun 
      as a homopolymeric fibre. These results suggest that varying the two protein ratios 
      beyond the natural 1:1 ratio will allow a high degree of tunability. With robust 
      heterologous expression and purification established, optimizing fibre spinning will 
      be accelerated compared to difficult to produce proteins such as spider silks.

LID - 131
AB  - Hagfishes (Myxinidae), a family of jawless marine pre-vertebrates, hold a unique 
      evolutionary position, sharing a joint ancestor with the entire vertebrate lineage. 
      They are thought to fulfil primarily the ecological niche of scavengers in the deep 
      ocean. However, we present new footage from baited video cameras that captured 
      images of hagfishes actively preying on other fish. Video images also revealed that 
      hagfishes are able to choke their would-be predators with gill-clogging slime. This 
      is the first time that predatory behaviour has been witnessed in this family, and 
      also demonstrates the instantaneous effectiveness of hagfish slime to deter fish 
      predators. These observations suggest that the functional adaptations and ecological 
      role of hagfishes, past and present, might be far more diverse than previously 
      assumed. We propose that the enduring success of this oldest extant family of fishes 
      over 300 million years could largely be due to their unique combination of 
      functional traits.

TI  - Hagfish: Champions of CO2 tolerance question the origins of vertebrate gill 
      function.
PG  - 11182
LID - 10.1038/srep11182 [doi]
LID - 11182
AB  - The gill is widely accepted to have played a key role in the adaptive radiation of 
      early vertebrates by supplanting the skin as the dominant site of gas exchange. 
      However, in the most basal extant craniates, the hagfishes, gills play only a minor 
      role in gas exchange. In contrast, we found hagfish gills to be associated with a 
      tremendous capacity for acid-base regulation. Indeed, Pacific hagfish exposed 
      acutely to severe sustained hypercarbia tolerated among the most severe blood 
      acidoses ever reported (1.2 pH unit reduction) and subsequently exhibited the 
      greatest degree of acid-base compensation ever observed in an aquatic chordate. This 
      was accomplished through an unprecedented increase in plasma [HCO3(-)] (>75 mM) in 
      exchange for [Cl(-)]. We thus propose that the first physiological function of the 
      ancestral gill was acid-base regulation, and that the gill was later co-opted for 
      its central role in gas exchange in more derived aquatic vertebrates.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance is spreading faster than the development of new antibiotics 
      into clinical practice. Currently, the design of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), 
      potential new antibacterial agents with rare antimicrobial resistance, is the 
      available strategy to enhance the antimicrobial activity and lower the toxicity of 
      AMPs. In this study, a peptide derived from hagfish intestinal peptide was designed 
      and termed as HF-18 (GFFKKAWRKVKKAFRRVL). After antimicrobial/bactericidal test in 
      vitro, we found that HF-18 exhibited a potent antimicrobial activity with MIC of 
      only 4 μg/ml against drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Meanwhile, it 
      eliminated the test bacteria within 1 h, suggesting its rapid bactericidal effect. 
      Importantly, this peptide had no obvious hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity to 
      mammalian cells. Furthermore, its notable antimicrobial effects in vivo was 
      confirmed again in S. aureus induced mouse bacteremia and skin wound infection, 
      reflecting as the decrease in bacterial counts in mouse lung or skin (up to 1.9 or 
      3.5 log CFU respectively), and including the inhibitory activity on inflammatory 
      cytokines secretion. The possible mechanisms underlying HF-18 against drug-resistant 
      S. aureus may attribute that HF-18 neutralized the negative charge in S. aureus 
      surface and then disrupted the integrity of cell membranes to enhance the permeation 
      of bacterial membrane, showing as the increased uptake of NPN and PI and the obvious 
      morphology changes of S. aureus. In addition, this peptide bound to bacterial 
      genomic DNA to suppress the expression of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (pvl) and 
      nuclease (nuc) genes, which play major roles in S. aureus virulence. The properties 
      of HF-18 suggest a path towards developing antibacterial agents that has stronger 
      antibacterial activity and greater security for clinical treatment of infection 
      induced by S. aureus, especially drug-resistant S. aureus.

TI  - In vitro characterisation of calcium influx across skin and gut epithelia of the 
      Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii.
PG  - 149-160
LID - 10.1007/s00360-020-01262-9 [doi]
AB  - Although hagfishes osmoconform, concentrations of calcium in their extracellular 
      fluids are maintained at levels lower than those of seawater. Ultimately, calcium 
      homeostasis is a product of relative rates of influx and efflux into the animal, but 
      little is known regarding these processes in hagfish. Using in vitro approaches, 
      calcium influx across gut and skin epithelia of the Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus 
      stoutii, was characterised. Analysis of concentration-dependent kinetics showed that 
      accumulation into skin tissue was linear at mucosal calcium concentrations up to 
      10 mM. However, movement into the serosal compartment was saturable, with a maximal 
      transport rate of 59 nmol cm(-2) h(-1) and an affinity (substrate concentration to 
      give half maximal transport rate) of 1139 µM. Calcium accumulation into gut tissue 
      and uptake into the gut serosal compartment was also saturable, with maximal 
      transport rates of 5.1 and 2.8 nmol cm(-2) h(-1), and affinities of 6417 and 
      3327 µM, respectively. A strong correlation between epidermal and intestinal calcium 
      tissue uptake was noted in assays where tissues were taken from the same individual. 
      Intestinal calcium influx was inhibited by nickel, but not significantly affected by 
      other putative inorganic (lanthanum, zinc) or organic (diltiazem, verapamil) 
      transport blockers. Inhibitors had no effect on skin calcium handling. These data 
      indicate that both gut and skin epithelia mediate calcium influx in hagfishes, 
      albeit via distinct mechanisms and with differences in responsiveness to potential 
      modifying factors.

TI  - Late development of hagfish vertebral elements.
PG  - 129-39
LID - 10.1002/jez.b.22489 [doi]
AB  - It has been demonstrated recently that hagfishes, one of two groups of extant 
      jawless vertebrates, have cartilaginous vertebral elements. Embryological and gene 
      expression analyses have also shown that this group of animals develops a 
      sclerotome, the potential primordium of the axial skeleton. However, it has not been 
      shown unequivocally that the hagfish sclerotome truly differentiates into cartilage, 
      because access to late-stage embryos and information about the cartilaginous 
      extracellular matrix (ECM) are lacking for these animals. Here we investigated the 
      expression patterns of the biglycan/decorin (BGN/DCN) gene in the inshore hagfish, 
      Eptatretus burgeri. The homologue of this gene encodes the major noncollagenous 
      component of the cartilaginous ECM among gnathostomes. We clearly identified the 
      expression of this gene in adult vertebral tissues and in embryonic mesenchymal 
      cells on the ventral aspect of the notochord. Taking into account that the 
      sclerotome in the gnathostomes expresses BGN/DCN gene during the chondrogenesis, it 
      is highly expected the hagfish BGN/DCN-positive mesenchymal cells are derived from 
      the sclerotomes. We propose that hagfishes and gnathostomes share conserved 
      developmental mechanisms not only in their somite differentiation, but also in 
      chondrogenesis of their vertebral elements.

TI  - Characterizing the metabolic capacity of the anoxic hagfish heart.
PG  - 3754-61
LID - 10.1242/jeb.125070 [doi]
AB  - Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii, can recover from 36 h of anoxia at 10°C. Such 
      anoxia tolerance demands the mobilization of anaerobic fuels and the removal of 
      metabolic wastes--processes that require a functional heart. The purpose of this 
      study was to measure the metabolic response of the excised, cannulated hagfish heart 
      to anoxia using direct calorimetry. These experiments were coupled with measurements 
      of cardiac pH and metabolite concentrations, at multiple time points, to monitor 
      acid-base balance and anaerobic ATP production. We also exposed hagfish to anoxia to 
      compare the in vitro responses of the excised hearts with the in vivo responses. The 
      calorimetry results revealed a significant reduction in the rate of metabolic heat 
      production over the first hour of anoxia exposure, and a recovery over the 
      subsequent 6 h. This response is likely attributable to a rapid anoxia-induced 
      depression of aerobic ATP-production pathways followed by an upregulation of 
      anaerobic ATP-production pathways such that the ATP production rate was restored to 
      that measured in normoxia. Glycogen-depletion measurements suggest that metabolic 
      processes were initially supported by glycolysis but that an alternative fuel source 
      was used to support the sustained rates of ATP production. The maintenance of 
      intracellular pH during anoxia indicates a remarkable ability of the myocytes to 
      buffer/regulate protons and thus protect cardiac function. Altogether, these results 
      illustrate that the low metabolic demand of the hagfish heart allows for 
      near-routine levels of cardiac metabolism to be supported anaerobically. This is 
      probably a significant contributor to the hagfish's exceptional anoxia tolerance.

TI  - Lipid acquisition and tissue storage in hagfish: new insights from an ancient 
      vertebrate.
PG  - 37-45
LID - 10.1007/s00360-018-1196-8 [doi]
AB  - Hagfishes are ancient vertebrates, which have the ability to tolerate nearly a year 
      of food deprivation with energy during fasting maintained using lipid stores. While 
      lipid transporters are evolutionarily conserved, there are relatively few studies 
      examining mechanisms of lipid acquisition in teleosts and no reports in the 
      primitive and evolutionarily important agnathans. We examined tissue lipid droplet 
      distribution and used gut sac preparations to characterize uptake mechanisms of the 
      monounsaturated fatty acid, oleic acid (OA; 18:1 cis-9), in the Pacific hagfish. OA 
      absorption was carrier-mediated and demonstrated saturable concentration-dependent 
      uptake with an affinity constant of 55 ± 7 µM, and a maximal rate of uptake of 
      1311 ± 97 pmol cm(- 2) h(- 1). Additionally, regulation of intestinal transport was 
      demonstrated as feeding significantly increased uptake. To further examine 
      post-prandial effects on fatty acid transport, hagfish were dosed with bovine 
      insulin, which had no effect on OA intestinal acquisition, but did lower plasma 
      glucose. Overall, this is the first evidence for intestinal fatty acid acquisition 
      in an agnathan, which are ideal models for understanding the evolution of nutrient 
      transport processes in vertebrates, and are particularly suited to lipid research 
      owing to their dependence upon this energy source during prolonged periods of 
      fasting.

TI  - Metabolic-morphologic events in the integument of the Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus 
      stoutii).
PG  - 235-55
AB  - Light- and electron-microscopic autoradiography were used to obtain a coordinated 
      metabolic-morphologic view of some of the events of cellular differentiation that 
      occur across the epidermis of the Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii) and which 
      enable this animal to secrete copious amounts of mucus. As judged by epidermal 
      incorporation of [3H]-thymidine in vivo, about 98% of DNA replication is confined to 
      the basal three layers of the total of 6--8 layers of cells. Small mucous cells 
      (SMC), the most numerous of the three major cell types involved in mucigenesis, show 
      in vitro and in vivo radioincorporation profiles of [3H]-L-lysine and 
      [3H]-D-glucosamine which differ markedly from those of [3H]-L-fucose and 
      [3H]-D-galactose. Time-course incorporation profiles (mean silver grains/cell and 
      percentage of cells with at least one cluster of silver grains) of [3H]-L-lysine and 
      [3H]-D-glucosamine not only reflected the metabolic activities of cell renewal and 
      differentiation in basally-located cells but also the high mucigenic activity in 
      cells near the epidermal surface. By contrast, [3H]-L-fucose and [3H]-D-galactose 
      were mainly incorporated by the more mature SMC in juxtanuclear regions near Golgi 
      complexes and newly formed secretory vesicles. The intensity of [3H]-fucose labeling 
      appeared proportional to the intensity of histochemical staining of the apical 
      cytoplasm. The prominent capsule, within SMC in basal and lateral regions, which 
      arises from a tight intermingling of tonofilaments, appears to restrict secretory 
      vesicles to apical regions while the cell progressively differentiates and migrates 
      to the epidermal surface. The other mucigenic cell types, large mucous cells and 
      thread cells, each show distinctive differentiation and radioincorporation patterns.

AB  - The origins of the vertebral elements and the underlying developmental mechanisms 
      have so far remained unclear, largely due to the unusual axial skeletal morphology 
      of hagfish, one of two extant jawless vertebrate clades. Hagfish axial supporting 
      tissue is generally believed to consist of the notochord and cartilaginous fin rays 
      only. However, careful investigations of whether vertebral elements are truly absent 
      in hagfish are scarce, and it is also unclear whether the axial skeletal morphology 
      of the hagfish is an ancestral or a derived condition. To address these questions, 
      we re-examined the axial skeletal morphology of the Japanese inshore hagfish 
      (Eptatretus burgeri). Based on a report published a century ago which implied the 
      existence of vertebral elements in hagfish, we conducted anatomical and histological 
      analyses of the hagfish axial skeletal systems and their development. Through this 
      analysis, we demonstrate that hagfish possesses sclerotome-derived cartilaginous 
      vertebral elements at the ventral aspect of the notochord. Based on (i) molecular 
      phylogenetic evidence in support of the monophyly of cyclostomes (hagfish and 
      lampreys) and jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes), and (ii) the morphology of the 
      vertebral elements in extant gnathostomes and cyclostomes, we propose that the 
      embryos of the common ancestor of all vertebrates would have possessed sclerotomal 
      cells that formed the segmentally arranged vertebral elements attached to the 
      notochord. We also conclude that the underlying developmental mechanisms are likely 
      to have been conserved among extinct jawless vertebrates and modern gnathostomes.

AB  - The defensive slime of hagfish consists of a polyanionic mucin hydrogel that 
      synergistically interacts with a fiber network forming a coherent and elastic 
      hydrogel in high ionic strength seawater. In seawater, the slime deploys in less 
      than a second entrapping large quantities of water by a well-timed thread skein 
      unravelling and mucous gel swelling. This rapid and vast hydrogel formation is 
      intriguing, as high ionic strength conditions generally counteract the swelling 
      speed and ratio of polyelectrolyte hydrogels. In this work we investigate the effect 
      of ionic strength and seawater cations on slime formation dynamics and 
      functionality. In the absence of ionic strength skeins swell radially and unravel 
      uncontrolled, probably causing tangling and creating a confined thread network that 
      entraps limited water. At high ionic strength skeins unravel, but create a collapsed 
      and dense fiber network. High ionic strength conditions therefore seem crucial for 
      controlled skein unraveling, however not sufficient for water retention. Only the 
      presence of naturally occurring Ca(2+) or Mg(2+)-ions allowed for an expanded 
      network and full water retention probably due to Ca(2+)-mediated vesicle rupture and 
      cross-linking of the mucin. Our study demonstrates that hagfish slime deployment is 
      a well-timed, ionic-strength, and divalent-cation dependent dynamic hydrogel 
      formation process.

TI  - High concentrations of trimethylamines in slime glands inhibit skein unraveling in 
      Pacific hagfish.

AB  - Hagfish defend themselves from fish predators by producing large volumes of 
      gill-clogging slime when they are attacked. The slime consists of seawater and two 
      major components that are ejected from the slime glands: mucus and threads. The 
      threads are produced within specialized cells and packaged into intricately coiled 
      bundles called skeins. Skeins are kept from unraveling via a protein adhesive that 
      dissolves when the skeins are ejected from the slime glands. Previous work revealed 
      that hagfish slime glands have high concentrations of methylamines including 
      trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), trimethylglycine (betaine) and dimethylglycine (DMG); 
      however, the function of these compounds in the slime glands is unknown. We 
      hypothesized that methylamines have stabilizing effects on the skeins that prevent 
      premature unraveling in the gland. To test this hypothesis, we quantified the effect 
      of methylamines on skein unraveling in Pacific hagfish and found that TMAO and 
      betaine have inhibitory effects on skein unraveling in vitro Furthermore, we found 
      that TMAO is a more effective inhibitor of unraveling than betaine, but the presence 
      of TMAO synergistically boosts the inhibitory action of betaine. Glycine and DMG 
      were far less effective inhibitors of unraveling at natural concentrations. Our 
      results support the hypothesis that high levels of trimethylamines in the slime 
      glands may act to hold the coiled thread skeins together within gland thread cells, 
      and they may do so by stabilizing adhesive proteins. These results advance our 
      knowledge of skein stabilization and deployment and provide yet another example of 
      trimethylamines functioning to stabilize proteins in a marine organism.

AB  - Inorganic phosphate (Pi) is an essential nutrient for all organisms, but in 
      seawater, Pi is a limiting nutrient. This study investigated the primary mechanisms 
      of Pi uptake in Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii) using ex vivo physiological and 
      molecular techniques. Hagfish were observed to have the capacity to absorb Pi from 
      the environment into at least three epithelial surfaces: the intestine, skin, and 
      gill. Pi uptake in all tissues was concentration dependent, and saturable Pi 
      transport was observed in the skin and gill at <2.0 mmol/l Pi. Gill and intestinal 
      Pi uptake was sodium dependent, but Pi uptake into the skin increased under low 
      sodium conditions. Gill Pi transport exhibited an apparent affinity constant 
      ~0.23-0.6 mmol/l Pi. A complete sequence of a type II sodium phosphate cotransporter 
      (Slc34a) was obtained from the hagfish gill. Phylogenetic analysis of the hagfish 
      Slc34a transporter indicates that it is earlier diverging than, and/or ancestral to, 
      the other identified vertebrate Slc34a transporters (Slc34a1, Slc34a2, and Slc34a3). 
      With the use of RT-PCR, the hagfish Slc34a transcript was detected in the intestine, 
      skin, gill, and kidney, suggesting that this may be the transporter involved in Pi 
      uptake into multiple epithelia in the hagfish. This is the first measurement of Pi 
      uptake across the gill or skin of any vertebrate animal and first sodium phosphate 
      cotransporter identified in hagfish.

AB  - This study investigates the role of branchial and extrabranchial processes in 
      acid-base regulation in the Pacific Hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii). Hagfish were 
      injected with one of the following solutions: acid saline (250mM HCl [pH=0.60], 
      250mM NaCl), alkaline saline (250mM NaHCO3, 250mM NaCl, [pH≈8.43]) or control saline 
      (500mM NaCl) in order to achieve an acid/alkaline/saline load of 6000μmol·kg(-1). 
      Using a custom designed hagfish compartmentalizing flux chamber, we partitioned flux 
      of net acid or base equivalents and ammonia into the anterior (gill+skin) and 
      posterior (skin+intestinal/renal/cloacal) components. We found that Pacific hagfish 
      excrete H(+) primarily via branchial mechanisms but base excretion occurs through 
      extrabranchial mechanisms located in the posterior region. In addition, we 
      demonstrate that hagfish are able to excrete ammonia via the skin although this flux 
      was not involved in compensation from an acid-base disturbance.

TI  - Hagfish embryos again: the end of a long drought.
PG  - 833-6
AB  - Hagfishes have long held a key place in discussions of early vertebrate evolution. 
      Frustratingly, one basis for such discussions -- namely hagfish embryology -- is 
      very incompletely known, because the embryos of these animals are notoriously 
      difficult to obtain. Fortunately, a recent publication on a Far Eastern hagfish 
      describes a workable procedure for obtaining embryos and then uses this precious 
      material to show that the hagfish neural crest arises by cell delamination as in 
      other vertebrates -- and not by epithelial outpouchings from the wall of the neural 
      tube as previously claimed. Importantly, because hagfish embryos should now be 
      available on a regular basis, the way is open for additional morphological and 
      developmental genetic investigations to help evaluate existing evolutionary 
      scenarios and perhaps suggest new ones.

AB  - Hagfishes use their defensive slime to ward off gill-breathing predators. Slime 
      gland refilling is a surprisingly slow process, and previous research has shown that 
      the composition of the slime exudate changes significantly during refilling, which 
      likely has consequences for the functionality of the slime. This study set out to 
      expand our understanding of slime gland refilling by examining the cellular 
      processes involved in refilling of the glands, as well as determining where in the 
      gland the main slime cells - the gland thread cells and gland mucous cells - arise. 
      Slime glands were electro-stimulated to exhaust their slime stores, left to refill 
      for set periods of time, and harvested for histological and immunohistochemical 
      examination. Whole slime glands, gland thread cell morphometrics and slime cell 
      proportions were examined over the refilling cycle. Slime glands decreased 
      significantly in size after exhaustion, but steadily increased in size over 
      refilling. Gland thread cells were the limiting factor in slime gland refilling, 
      taking longer to replenish and mature than gland mucous cells. Newly produced gland 
      thread cells underwent most of their growth near the edge of the gland, and larger 
      cells were found farthest from the edge of the gland. Immunohistochemical analysis 
      also revealed proliferating cells only within the epithelial lining of the slime 
      gland, suggesting that new slime cells originate from undifferentiated cells lining 
      the gland. Our results provide an in-depth look at the cellular dynamics of slime 
      gland refilling in Pacific hagfish, and provide a model for how slime glands refill 
      at the cellular level.

      (Eptatretus stoutii).

AB  - Hagfishes are unique to the vertebrate lineage in that they acquire dissolved 
      nutrients across multiple epithelia including the intestine, gill, and skin. This 
      feat has been attributed to their immersive feeding behavior that likely 
      simultaneously provides benefits (nutrient rich) and potentially adverse 
      (hypercapnia, hypoxia, high environmental ammonia) physiological effects. 
      Examinations have been conducted of the ex vivo transport capabilities of specific 
      nutrients as well as in vivo effects of the hypothesized feeding environments, yet 
      the physiological effects of feeding itself have never been elucidated. We examined 
      the post-prandial physiology of Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii), identifying 
      changes in oxygen consumption, acid-base balance, ammonia waste excretion, and 
      intestinal morphology following feeding in captivity. Following voluntary feeding, 
      post-prandial oxygen consumption was significantly elevated 
      (1868 ± 272 µmol kg(-1) h(-1)) 8 h following feeding when compared to control 
      resting metabolic oxygen consumption (642 ± 51 µmol kg(-1) h(-1)) and resulted in a 
      factorial metabolic scope of 2.92. Changes in acid-base status were not observed 
      following feeding in either the excreted components or the caudal blood samples; 
      however, a significant alkalosis was observed 8 h post-feeding in the major 
      intestinal blood vein. Significant increases (16-fold) in ammonia excretion were 
      recorded in 36 h post-fed hagfish. Finally, significant post-prandial increases in 
      intestinal mucosal thickness and microvilli length were observed, with mucosal 
      thickness remaining significantly increased throughout 36 h and the microvilli 
      length returning to fasted lengths by 36 h. These results demonstrate the 
      post-feeding physiology of the earliest diverging extant craniate and identify 
      correlations between physiology and hindgut morphology 8 h following feeding.

TI  - Powering the hagfish "bite": The functional morphology of the retractor complex of 
      two hagfish feeding apparatuses.
PG  - 827-840
LID - 10.1002/jmor.20986 [doi]
AB  - Hagfish use forceful retractions of a dental plate to shear and ingest food. 
      Retractile force is generated by the retractor muscle complex of the posterior 
      hagfish feeding apparatus (HFA). While gross morphological descriptions exist, the 
      organization of muscle and connective tissue fibers that form the soft tissue 
      retractor complex do not. In this study, we used paraffin histology to prepare 
      serial sections of Pacific (Eptatretus stoutii, Lockington, 1879) and Atlantic 
      (Myxine glutinosa, Linnaeus, 1758) hagfishes in order to describe constituent soft 
      tissue anatomy and fiber orientations. We generated 3D reconstructions in which 
      digitized sections were segmented and fitted to volumetric scans of retractor 
      complexes taken prior to microtomy. These models confirmed that the retractor 
      complex is composed of a perpendicularis muscle that fits within the eye of a 
      needle-shaped clavatus muscle, which anteriorly bears the dental plate tendon, and 
      in turn fits within a sleeve-like tubulatus muscle. Analysis of fiber orientations 
      within these muscles resulted in novel functional hypotheses: (a) The tubulatus 
      muscle represents a novel tubular bipennate muscle with a considerable physiological 
      cross-sectional area. Its activation may indirectly create tension in the dental 
      plate tendon: as the tubulatus muscle forcefully extends, it displaces the terminal 
      bulb and the clavatus muscle posteriorly. (b) Within the HFA terminal bulb, the 
      muscle fibers of the clavatus and perpendicularis muscles are mutually perpendicular 
      and may cocontract to form a swelling stopper knot-like muscular complex that 
      resists being pulled through the tubulatus muscle. (c) While overall feeding 
      apparatus muscle morphology is conserved, the physiological cross-sectional area of 
      the tubulatus muscle in E. stoutii, is relatively larger than that of M. glutinosa, 
      suggesting a more forceful retraction. The tubular bipennate construction of the 
      tubulatus may represent a novel soft robotic actuator design.

TI  - From hagfish to humans: teaching comparative physiology to internal medicine 
      residents.
PG  - 372-7
LID - 10.1097/ACM.0b013e3182444c1b [doi]
AB  - With more clinical information for trainees to master in the face of increasing time 
      pressures, discussions about underlying physiology and the mechanisms of disease 
      seem to have been de-emphasized during residency training. This reduced focus on 
      pathophysiology and basic science may weaken trainees' clinical effectiveness and 
      reduce their interest in pursuing research careers.In response, the authors helped 
      to develop in 2006 a one-week immersive comparative physiology course for second- 
      and third-year internal medicine residents at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. 
      The course, held at the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, includes four 
      modules (hematology, vascular physiology, secretory physiology, and salt and water 
      homeostasis), each composed of basic science experiments using aquatic species and 
      accompanied by clinical correlation discussions and group presentations.From 2007 to 
      2010, 72 residents rotated through the course. Most reported that it enhanced their 
      understanding of the mechanisms of disease in their patients. After the course, 
      residents reported that physiology played a more prominent role in their teaching 
      and clinical decision making during both ward and intensive care unit rotations. 
      They also reported being more likely than before the course to read about the 
      pathophysiology of disease when faced with a clinical problem.Although 
      cost-intensive and geographically unique, this model for teaching the mechanisms of 
      disease could be applied elsewhere with the help of physician-scientists and 
      clinician-educators. In this article, the authors describe the development of the 
      course, share preliminary data evaluating progress toward its goals, and discuss 
      future directions and lessons learned.

TI  - Gill ultrastructure of the Pacific hagfish Eptatretus stouti.
PG  - 243-69
AB  - At the gross anatomical level, hagfish gills show unusual features not seen in any 
      other fish gills. Our study was undertaken to determine if peculiarities also 
      characterize the microscopic anatomy and ultrastructure of hagfish gills. To the 
      contrary, branchial respiratory lamellae of Pacific hagfish were found to resemble 
      the lamellae of lampreys, elasmobranchs, and teleosts, often down to the finest 
      subcellular details. As in other fish, hagfish lamellae are lined by epithelium 
      containing pavement cells with organelles indicative of a secretory function, basal 
      cells showing undifferentiated cell features, and branchial ionocytes. The ionocytes 
      are identical to chloride cells of teleosts in cytostructure, distribution, and 
      abundance. There are pillar and marginal capillaries in hagfish gill lamellae. 
      Pillar cells contain bundles of 5-nm microfilaments, and they associate with 
      collagen columns as in other fish. Hagfish pillar cells do exhibit odd features, 
      however: They cluster (groups of up to nine were seen), and their extracellular 
      collagen columns are rarer than in other fish gills (averaging only two columns per 
      three pillar cells). Other special features of hagfish gills are the following: 
      lipid droplets and smooth endoplasmic reticulum are well developed in all cell 
      types; pavement cells secrete a lipomucous product (stains with periodic 
      acid-Schiff, Alcian blue, and Sudan black B); and goblet cells are absent. The 
      presence of "chloride cells" in hagfish is puzzling, as hagfish body fluids are 
      iso-osmotic to seawater and there is no need to osmoregulate for sodium chloride; 
      the ionocytes contain carbonic anhydrase, suggesting a function in acid/base 
      regulation.

AB  - The goal of this study was to identify whether Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii) 
      possess glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid responses and to examine the potential 
      role(s) of four key steroids in these responses. Pacific hagfish were injected with 
      varying amounts of cortisol, corticosterone or 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) using 
      coconut oil implants and plasma glucose and gill total-ATPase activity were 
      monitored as indices of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid responses. Furthermore, 
      we also monitored plasma glucose and 11-deoxycortisol (11-DOC) levels following 
      exhaustive stress (30 min of agitation) or following repeated infusion with 
      SO(4)(2-). There were no changes in gill total-ATPase following implantation with 
      any steroid, with only very small statistical increases in plasma glucose noted in 
      hagfish implanted with either DOC (at 20 and 200mgkg(-1) at 7 and 4days 
      post-injection, respectively) or corticosterone (at 100mgkg(-1) at 7days 
      post-injection). Following exhaustive stress, hagfish displayed a large and 
      sustained increase in plasma glucose. Repeated infusion of SO(4)(2-) into hagfish 
      caused increases in both plasma glucose levels and SO(4)(2-) excretion rate 
      suggesting a regulated glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid response. However, 
      animals under either condition did not show any significant increases in plasma 
      11-DOC concentrations. Our results suggest that while there are active 
      glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid responses in hagfish, 11-DOC does not appear to 
      be involved and the identity and primary function of the steroid in hagfish remains 
      to be elucidated.

AB  - All vertebrates, from jawless fish to mammals, possess adaptive immune systems that 
      can detect and inactivate non-self-antigens through a vast repertoire of antigen 
      receptors. Unlike jawed vertebrates, the hagfish utilizes variable lymphocyte 
      receptors (VLRs) that are unrelated to immunoglobulin molecules but are diversified 
      by copy-choice gene conversion mechanism. Here, we report that hagfish VLRs react 
      with allogenic leukocyte antigens but not with self-antigens. We found that a highly 
      polymorphic membrane protein, NICIR3, is recognized by VLRs as an allogenic 
      leukocyte antigen (ALA). In a serological cross-reactivity test, a close correlation 
      was observed between the amino acid differences in the protein sequences and the VLR 
      cross-reactivities. This leukocyte antigen was predominantly expressed in phagocytic 
      leukocytes, where it was associated with phagocytosed protein antigens. These 
      findings suggest that a polymorphic leukocyte antigen, NICIR3/ALA, plays a pivotal 
      role in jawless vertebrate adaptive immunity.

TI  - Flexible ammonia handling strategies using both cutaneous and branchial epithelia in 
      the highly ammonia-tolerant Pacific hagfish.
PG  - R78-R90
LID - 10.1152/ajpregu.00351.2016 [doi]
AB  - Hagfish consume carrion, potentially exposing them to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and high 
      environmental ammonia (HEA). We investigated branchial and cutaneous ammonia 
      handling strategies by which Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii) tolerate and 
      recover from high ammonia loading. Hagfish were exposed to HEA (20 mmol/l) for 48 h 
      to elevate plasma total ammonia (T(Amm)) levels before placement into divided 
      chambers for a 4-h recovery period in ammonia-free seawater where ammonia excretion 
      (J(Amm)) was measured independently in the anterior and posterior compartments. 
      Localized HEA exposures were also conducted by subjecting hagfish to HEA in either 
      the anterior or posterior compartments. During recovery, HEA-exposed animals 
      increased J(Amm) in both compartments, with the posterior compartment comprising 
      ~20% of the total J(Amm) compared with ~11% in non-HEA-exposed fish. Plasma T(Amm) 
      increased substantially when whole hagfish and the posterior regions were exposed to 
      HEA. Alternatively, plasma T(Amm) did not elevate after anterior localized HEA 
      exposure. J(Amm) was concentration dependent (0.05-5 mmol/l) across excised skin 
      patches at up to eightfold greater rates than in skin sections that were excised 
      from HEA-exposed hagfish. Skin excised from more posterior regions displayed greater 
      J(Amm) than those from more anterior regions. Immunohistochemistry with 
      hagfish-specific anti-rhesus glycoprotein type c (α-hRhcg; ammonia transporter) 
      antibody was characterized by staining on the basal aspect of hagfish epidermis 
      while Western blotting demonstrated greater expression of Rhcg in more posterior 
      skin sections. We conclude that cutaneous Rhcg proteins are involved in cutaneous 
      ammonia excretion by Pacific hagfish and that this mechanism could be particularly 
      important during feeding.

TI  - Immunohistochemical detection of prolactin-releasing peptide2 in the brain of the

AB  - Prolactin-releasing peptide2 (PrRP2) belongs to the RFamide peptide group and is a 
      paralog of prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP). Recent studies demonstrated that 
      PrRP2, but not PrRP, regulates prolactin release in teleosts. The evolutionary 
      origin of PrRP and PrRP2 dates back to at least early vertebrates because homologs 
      of PrRP/PrRP2 were identified in lampreys, one of the earliest branch of vertebrates 
      class Agnatha. However, PrRP/PrRP2 remains to be identified in hagfish, another 
      representative species of class Agnatha. Here, we examined the distribution of PrRP2 
      in the brain and pituitary of the inshore hagfish Eptatretus burgeri to obtain 
      further understanding of the neuroendocrine system of PrRP2. PrRP2-immunoreactive 
      (ir) cell bodies were detected in the infundibular nucleus of hypothalamus (HYinf). 
      PrRP2-ir fibers were restricted around PrRP2-ir cell bodies and were not detected in 
      the dorsal wall of the neurohypophysis compared to the abundant PrRP2-ir fiber 
      distribution in the brain and innervation to the pituitary in other vertebrates. To 
      examine possible reciprocal connections of PrRP2 and other neuropeptides, we further 
      conducted dual-label immunohistochemistry of PrRP2 and the PQRFamide (PQRFa) peptide 
      or corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Reciprocal connections are suggested 
      between PrRP2 and PQRFa neurons as well as between PrRP2 and CRH neurons. The 
      present study demonstrates, for the first time, that PrRP2 is expressed in the brain 
      of inshore hagfish. The restricted distribution of PrRP2-ir fibers in the HYinf 
      suggests that PrRP2 does not directly regulate the pituitary gland, but regulates 
      the function of the HYinf where PQRFa and CRH are expressed.

AB  - Ventilatory sensitivity to ammonia occurs in teleosts, elasmobranchs and mammals. 
      Here, we investigated whether the response is also present in hagfish. Ventilatory 
      parameters (nostril flow, pressure amplitude, velar frequency and ventilatory index, 
      the last representing the product of pressure amplitude and frequency), together 
      with blood and water chemistry, were measured in hagfish exposed to either high 
      environmental ammonia (HEA) in the external sea water or internal ammonia loading by 
      intra-vascular injection. HEA exposure (10 mmol l(-1) NH(4)HCO(3) or 10 mmol l(-1) 
      NH(4)Cl) caused a persistent hyperventilation by 3 h, but further detailed analysis 
      of the NH(4)HCO(3) response showed that initially (within 5 min) there was a marked 
      decrease in ventilation (80% reduction in ventilatory index and nostril flow), 
      followed by a later 3-fold increase, by which time plasma total ammonia 
      concentration had increased 11-fold. Thus, hyperventilation in HEA appeared to be an 
      indirect response to internal ammonia elevation, rather than a direct response to 
      external ammonia. HEA-mediated increases in oxygen consumption also occurred. 
      Responses to NH(4)HCO(3) were greater than those to NH(4)Cl, reflecting greater 
      increases over time in water pH and P (NH(3))  in the former. Hagfish also exhibited 
      hyperventilation in response to direct injection of isotonic NH(4)HCO(3) or NH(4)Cl 
      solutions into the caudal sinus. In all cases where hyperventilation occurred, 
      plasma total ammonia and P (NH(3))  levels increased significantly, while blood 
      acid-base status remained unchanged, indicating specific responses to internal 
      ammonia elevation. The sensitivity of breathing to ammonia arose very early in 
      vertebrate evolution.

TI  - Regulation of antigen-receptor gene assembly in hagfish.
PG  - 126-32
LID - 10.1038/embor.2009.274 [doi]
AB  - Variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) are antigen receptors in the jawless 
      vertebrates lamprey and hagfish. VLR genes are classified into VLRA and VLRB, and 
      lymphocytes expressing VLRA are T-cell-like, whereas those expressing VLRB are 
      B-cell-like in the sea lamprey. Diverse VLR genes are assembled somatically in 
      lymphocytes; however, how the assembly is regulated is still largely unknown. Here, 
      we analyse VLR gene assembly at the single-cell level in the inshore hagfish 
      (Eptatretus burgeri). Each lymphocyte assembles and transcribes only one type of VLR 
      gene, either VLRA or VLRB. In general, monoallelic assembly of VLR was observed, but 
      diallelic assembly was found in some cases--in many of which, one allele was 
      functional and the other was defective. In fact, all VLR-assembled lymphocytes 
      contained at least one functional VLR gene. Together, these results indicate a 
      feedback inhibition of VLR assembly and selection of VLR-positive lymphocytes.

TI  - Structure and function of lactate dehydrogenase from hagfish.
PG  - 594-607
LID - 10.3390/md8030594 [doi]
AB  - The lactate dehydrogenases (LDHs) in hagfish have been estimated to be the prototype 
      of those in higher vertebrates. The effects of high hydrostatic pressure from 0.1 to 
      100 MPa on LDH activities from three hagfishes were examined. The LDH activities of 
      Eptatretus burgeri, living at 45-60 m, were completely lost at 5 MPa. In contrast, 
      LDH-A and -B in Eptatretus okinoseanus maintained 70% of their activities even at 
      100 MPa. These results show that the deeper the habitat, the higher the tolerance to 
      pressure. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms for adaptation to high pressure, we 
      compared the amino acid sequences and three-dimensional structures of LDHs in these 
      hagfish. There were differences in six amino acids (6, 10, 20, 156, 269, and 341). 
      These amino acidresidues are likely to contribute to the stability of the E. 
      okinoseanus LDH under high-pressure conditions. The amino acids responsible for the 
      pressure tolerance of hagfish are the same in both human and hagfish LDHs, and one 
      substitution that occurred as an adaptation during evolution is coincident with that 
      observed in a human disease. Mutation of these amino acids can cause anomalies that 
      may be implicated in the development of human diseases.

      pericardium.
PG  - 853-65
LID - 10.1002/jmor.20539 [doi]
AB  - The morphological characteristics of the venous pole and pericardium of the heart 
      were examined in three hagfish species, Myxine glutinosa, Eptatretus stoutii, and 
      Eptatretus cirrhatus. In these species, the atrioventricular (AV) canal is long, 
      funnel-shaped and contains small amounts of myocardium. The AV valve is formed by 
      two pocket-like leaflets that lack a papillary system. The atrial wall is formed by 
      interconnected muscle trabeculae and a well-defined collagenous system. The sinus 
      venosus (SV) shows a collagenous wall and is connected to the left side of the 
      atrium. An abrupt collagen-muscle boundary marks the SV-atrium transition. It is 
      hypothesized that the SV is not homologous to that of other vertebrates which could 
      have important implications for understanding heart evolution. In M. glutinosa and 
      E. stoutii, the pericardium is a closed bag that hangs from the tissues dorsal to 
      the heart and encloses both the heart and the ventral aorta. In contrast, the 
      pericardium is continuous with the loose periaortic tissue in E. cirrhatus. In all 
      three species, the pericardium ends at the level of the SV excluding most of the 
      atrium from the pericardial cavity. In M. glutinosa and E. stoutii, connective 
      bridges extend between the base of the aorta and the ventricular wall. In E. 
      cirrhatus, the connections between the periaortic tissue and the ventricle may carry 
      blood vessels that reach the ventricular base. A further difference specific to E. 
      cirrhatus is that the adipose tissue associated with the pericardium contains 
      thyroid follicles. J. Morphol. 277:853-865, 2016. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Ammonia excretion in the Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) and responses of an Rhc 
      glycoprotein.
PG  - R769-78
LID - 10.1152/ajpregu.00355.2014 [doi]
AB  - Hagfishes, the most ancient of the extant craniates, demonstrate a high tolerance 
      for a number of unfavorable environmental conditions, including elevated ammonia. 
      Proposed mechanisms of ammonia excretion in aquatic organisms include vesicular 
      NH(4)(+) transport and release by exocytosis in marine crabs, and passive NH(3) 
      diffusion, active NH(4)(+) transport, and paracellular leakage of NH3 or NH(4)(+) 
      across the gills of fishes. Recently, an emerging paradigm suggests that Rhesus 
      glycoproteins play a vital role in ammonia transport in both aquatic invertebrates 
      and vertebrates. This study has identified an Rh glycoprotein ortholog from the 
      gills of Atlantic hagfish. The hagfish Rhcg shares a 56-60% amino acid identity to 
      other vertebrate Rhcg cDNAs. Sequence information was used to produce an 
      anti-hagfish Rhcg (hRhcg) antibody. We have used hRhcg to localize protein 
      expression to epithelial cells of the gill and the skin. In addition, we have 
      quantified hRhcg expression following exposure to elevated plasma ammonia levels. 
      Animals exposed to a 3 mmol/kg NH(4)Cl load resulted in significantly elevated 
      plasma ammonia concentrations compared with controls for up to 4 h postinjection. 
      This correlated with net ammonia excretion rates that were also significantly 
      elevated for up to 4 h postinjection. Rhcg mRNA expression in both the gill and skin 
      was significantly elevated by 15 min and 1 h, respectively, and hRhcg protein 
      expression in gills was significantly elevated at 2, 4, and 8 h postinjection. These 
      results demonstrate a potential role for Rhcg in the excretion of ammonia in the 
      Atlantic hagfish.

TI  - Chemotactic responses of hagfish (Vertebrata, Agnatha) leucocytes.
PG  - 295-303
AB  - The chemotactic responses of hagfish leucocytes were tested using a variety of 
      chemoattractants. Leucocyte migration was significantly enhanced by purified 
      mammalian complement anaphylotoxin (C5a) and LPS-activated hagfish plasma. 
      Checkerboard analyses confirmed that the responses of leucocytes to both of these 
      chemoattractants were directed along concentration gradients (chemotaxis) and did 
      not result from accelerated random movement (chemokinesis). Chemotaxis was 
      undertaken by leucocyte fractions that were enriched in granulocytes, the 
      predominant phagocytic cells of hagfish. The data suggest that chemotactic 
      mechanisms may have been conserved during evolution to such a degree that mammalian 
      chemoattractants can bind and activate chemotactic receptors on hagfish leucocytes. 
      Moreover, hagfish appear to express plasma proteins that are structurally and 
      functionally homologous to mammalian complement anaphylotoxins.

TI  - Reconstructing the ancestral vertebrate brain.
PG  - 163-174
LID - 10.1111/dgd.12347 [doi]
AB  - Highly complicated morphologies and sophisticated functions of vertebrate brains 
      have been established through evolution. However, the origin and early evolutionary 
      history of the brain remain elusive, owing to lack of information regarding the 
      brain architecture of extant and fossil species of jawless vertebrates (agnathans). 
      Comparative analyses of the brain of less studied cyclostomes (only extant agnathan 
      group, consisting of lampreys and hagfish) with the well-known sister group of jawed 
      vertebrates (gnathostomes) are the only tools we have available to illustrate the 
      ancestral architecture of the vertebrate brain. Previous developmental studies had 
      shown that the lamprey lacked well-established brain compartments that are present 
      in gnathostomes, such as the medial ganglionic eminence and the rhombic lip. The 
      most accepted scenario suggested that cyclostomes had fewer compartments than that 
      of the gnathostome brain and that gnathostomes thus evolved by a stepwise addition 
      of innovations on its developmental sequence. However, recent studies have revealed 
      that these compartments are present in hagfish embryos, indicating that these brain 
      regions have been acquired before the split of cyclostomes and gnathostomes. By 
      comparing two cyclostome lineages and gnathostomes, it has become possible to 
      speculate about a more complex ancestral state of the brain, excluding derived 
      traits in either of the lineages. In this review, we summarize recent studies on the 
      brain development of the lamprey and hagfish. Then, we attempt to reconstruct the 
      possible brain architecture of the last common ancestor of vertebrates. Finally, we 
      discuss how the developmental plan of the vertebrate brain has been modified 
      independently in different vertebrate lineages.

TI  - Hagfish leukocytes express a paired receptor family with a variable domain 
      resembling those of antigen receptors.
PG  - 2885-91
AB  - Jawed vertebrates are equipped with TCR and BCR with the capacity to rearrange their 
      V domains. By contrast, jawless vertebrates, represented by hagfish and lampreys, 
      apparently lack such receptors. We describe in this study a family of hagfish genes 
      carrying a single V-type domain resembling those of TCR/BCR. This multigene family, 
      which we call agnathan paired receptors resembling Ag receptors (APAR), is expressed 
      in leukocytes and predicted to encode a group of membrane glycoproteins with 
      organizations characteristic of paired Ig-like receptors, consisting of activating 
      and inhibitory forms. APAR has a J region in its V-type domain, and its V and J 
      regions are encoded in a single exon. Thus, APAR is a member of the emerging 
      families of diversified, innate immune-type receptors with TCR/BCR-like V-type 
      domains and has many of the features expected for a primordial TCR/BCR-like 
      receptor. The extracellular domain of APAR may be descended from a V-type domain 
      postulated to have acquired recombination signal sequences in a jawed vertebrate 
      lineage.

AB  - Hagfishes are living representatives of the earliest-diverging vertebrates and are 
      thus useful for the study of early vertebrate physiology. It has been previously 
      postulated that digestive enzymes account for the majority of digestion because 
      hagfish are agastric with notable zymogen granules in specialized cells of the 
      hindgut. While the presence of some digestive enzymes (amylase, lipase and 
      leucinaminopeptidase) have been confirmed with histochemistry, quantification of 
      enzymatic activity is limited. This study sought to biochemically quantify the 
      tissue activity of six digestive enzymes (α-amylase, maltase, lipase, trypsin, 
      aminopeptidase and alkaline phosphatase) along the length of the Pacific hagfish 
      (Eptatretus stoutii) alimentary canal. In addition, the effect of feeding on the 
      rate of enzyme activity was examined. Overall, maltase and trypsin activities were 
      unchanging with respect to location or feeding status, while the activities of 
      α-amylase and alkaline phosphatase decreased substantially following feeding, but 
      were consistent along the length. Lipase and aminopeptidase activities were elevated 
      in the anterior region of the alimentary canal in comparison to the more posterior 
      regions, but were not altered with feeding. This study indicates hagfish have an 
      assortment of digestive enzymes that likely are the result of a varied diet. The 
      differential expression of these enzymes along the tract and in regards to feeding 
      may be indications of early compartmentalization of digestive function.

TI  - Hagfish humoral defense protein exhibits structural and functional homology with 
      mammalian complement components.
PG  - 7910-4
AB  - A genomic clone and cDNA fragment encoding a portion of a humoral recognition 
      molecule from the hagfish were isolated and sequenced. The serum protein has 
      previously been described as having structural features that are 
      immunoglobulin-like. Amino acid sequence obtained from the 77-kDa H1 heavy chain 
      facilitated the isolation of a genomic clone containing at least two coding regions. 
      Through use of primers derived from the genomic sequences, a 231-base-pair cDNA 
      fragment was obtained by PCR from liver RNA. Comparison of the deduced 120-amino 
      acid sequence from the N terminus of H1 with known protein sequences revealed 
      substantial sequence similarity with the beta chain of the murine fourth complement 
      component C4 and with the related third and fifth complement molecules C5 and C3 and 
      the major histocompatibility complex-encoded sex-limited protein. Observation of 
      structural and functional similarities associated with the sequence similarity 
      indicate that these molecules share an evolutionary relationship: the polypeptide 
      chain structure of hagfish complement-like protein (CLP) resembles that of C4; CLP 
      contains a hidden thioester group on the 70-kDa chain; CLP binds to streptococcal 
      cells and enhances the phagocytosis of yeast by hagfish leukocytes. These data 
      suggest that CLP forms part of a non-clonally-derived complement-related humoral 
      defense system in the hagfish.

      different.

LID - 10.1266/ggs.17-00004 [doi]
AB  - The brown hagfish (Eptatretus atami) is one of several known hagfish species 
      occurring in Japanese coastal waters. To date, there has been no research studying 
      genetic polymorphisms in the species. In the present study, we analyzed differences 
      in nucleotide sequences between two populations: one from Suruga Bay on the Pacific 
      coast of Honshu, Japan, and the other from the Sea of Japan, off Akita on the 
      northwest coast of Honshu. We sequenced part of the cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 
      gene (COX1) from the mitochondrial genome, and three G protein-coupled receptor 
      genes from the nuclear genome. Phylogenetic networks of all four genes showed 
      divergence between the two populations. Further, comparison of the COX1 data using a 
      phylogenetic tree for a range of hagfish species indicated clear differences between 
      the populations, suggesting that they differ at the species level. The numbers of 
      their teeth, in particular of fused cusps (anterior/posterior multicusps), also 
      supported these findings. Individuals of the Suruga Bay population had 3/3 fused 
      cusps, as described for E. atami, whereas individuals of the Akita population had 
      3/2 fused cusps. These results suggest that the brown hagfish from the Sea of Japan, 
      off the northwest coast of Honshu, is a distinct species from E. atami.

TI  - Evolutionary origin of a functional gonadotropin in the pituitary of the most 
      primitive vertebrate, hagfish.
PG  - 15832-7

AB  - Hagfish, which lack both jaws and vertebrae, are considered the most primitive 
      vertebrate known, living or extinct. Hagfish have long been the enigma of vertebrate 
      evolution not only because of their evolutionary position, but also because of our 
      lack of knowledge on fundamental processes. Key elements of the reproductive 
      endocrine system in hagfish have yet to be elucidated. Here, the presence and 
      identity of a functional glycoprotein hormone (GPH) have been elucidated from the 
      brown hagfish Paramyxine atami. The hagfish GPH consists of two subunits, alpha and 
      beta, which are synthesized and colocalized in the same cells of the 
      adenohypophysis. The cellular and transcriptional activities of hagfish GPHalpha and 
      -beta were significantly correlated with the developmental stages of the gonad. The 
      purified native GPH induced the release of gonadal sex steroids in vitro. From our 
      phylogenetic analysis, we propose that ancestral glycoprotein alpha-subunit 2 (GPA2) 
      and beta-subunit 5 (GPB5) gave rise to GPHalpha and GPHbeta of the vertebrate 
      glycoprotein hormone family, respectively. The identified hagfish GPHalpha and -beta 
      subunits appear to be the typical gnathostome GPHalpha and -beta subunits based on 
      the sequence and phylogenetic analyses. We hypothesize that the identity of a single 
      functional GPH of the hagfish, hagfish GTH, provides critical evidence for the 
      existence of a pituitary-gonadal system in the earliest divergent vertebrate that 
      likely evolved from an ancestral, prevertebrate exclusively neuroendocrine mechanism 
      by gradual emergence of a previously undescribed control level, the pituitary, which 
      is not found in the Protochordates.

TI  - Self-Assembly of Recombinant Hagfish Thread Keratins Amenable to a Strain-Induced 
      α-Helix to β-Sheet Transition.
PG  - 2327-39
LID - 10.1021/acs.biomac.5b00552 [doi]
AB  - Hagfish slime threads are assembled from protein-based bundles of intermediate 
      filaments (IFs) that undergo a strain-induced α-helical coiled-coil to β-sheet 
      transition. Draw processing of native fibers enables the creation of mechanically 
      tuned materials, and under optimized conditions this process results in mechanical 
      properties similar to spider dragline silk. In this study, we develop the foundation 
      for the engineering of biomimetic recombinant hagfish thread keratin (TK)-based 
      materials. The two protein constituents from the hagfish Eptatretus stoutii thread, 
      named EsTKα and EsTKγ, were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Individual 
      (rec)EsTKs and mixtures thereof were subjected to stepwise dialysis to evaluate 
      their protein solubility, folding, and self-assembly propensities. Conditions were 
      identified that resulted in the self-assembly of coiled-coil rich IF-like filaments, 
      as determined by circular dichroism (CD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). 
      Rheology experiments indicated that the concentrated filaments assembled into 
      gel-like networks exhibiting a rheological response reminiscent to that of IFs. 
      Notably, the self-assembled filaments underwent an α-helical coiled-coil to β-sheet 
      transition when subjected to oscillatory shear, thus mimicking the critical 
      characteristic responsible for mechanical strengthening of native hagfish threads. 
      We propose that our data establish the foundation to create robust and tunable 
      recombinant TK-based materials whose mechanical properties are controlled by a 
      strain-induced α-helical coiled-coil to β-sheet transition.

TI  - Anoxic survival of the Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii).
PG  - 361-71
LID - 10.1007/s00360-010-0532-4 [doi]
AB  - It is not known how the Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii) can survive extended 
      periods of anoxia. The present study used two experimental approaches to examine 
      energy use during and following anoxic exposure periods of different durations (6, 
      24 and 36 h). By measuring oxygen consumption prior to anoxic exposure, we detected 
      a circadian rhythm, with hagfish being active during night and showing a minimum 
      routine oxygen consumption (RMR) during the daytime. By measuring the excess 
      post-anoxic oxygen consumption (EPAOC) after 6 and 24 h it was possible to 
      mathematically account for RMR being maintained even though heme stores of oxygen 
      would have been depleted by the animal's metabolism during the first hours of 
      anoxia. However, EPAOC after 36 h of anoxia could not account for RMR being 
      maintained. Measurements of tissue glycogen disappearance and lactate appearance 
      during anoxia showed that the degree of glycolysis and the timing of its activation 
      varied among tissues. Yet, neither measurement could account for the RMR being 
      maintained during even the 6-h anoxic period. Therefore, two independent analyses of 
      the metabolic responses of hagfish to anoxia exposure suggest that hagfish utilize 
      metabolic rate suppression as part of the strategy for longer-term anoxia survival.

AB  - The hagfish, a group of extant jawless fish, are known to lack true vertebrae and, 
      for this reason, have often been excluded from the group Vertebrata. However, it has 
      yet to be conclusively shown whether hagfish lack all vertebra-like structures, and 
      whether their somites follow developmental processes and patterning distinct from 
      those in lampreys and gnathostomes. Here we report the presence of vertebra-like 
      cartilages in the in-shore hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri. These elements arise as 
      small nodules occupying anatomical positions comparable to those of gnathostome 
      vertebrae. Examination of hagfish embryos suggests that the ventromedial portion of 
      a somite transforms into mesenchymal cells that express cognates of Pax1/9 and 
      Twist, strikingly similar to the pattern of sclerotome development in gnathostomes. 
      We conclude that the vertebra-like elements in the hagfish are homologous to 
      gnathostome vertebrae, implying that this animal underwent secondary reduction of 
      vertebrae in most of the trunk.

TI  - Morphology and kinematics of feeding in hagfish: possible functional advantages of 
      jaws.
PG  - 3897-909
AB  - As in gnathostomes, the hagfish feeding apparatus includes skeletal, dental and 
      muscular components. In the present study, we examined feeding morphology and 
      kinematics in two hagfish species, Eptatretus stoutii and Myxine glutinosa, 
      representing the two major hagfish lineages. E. stoutii have larger dental plates, 
      larger basal plates, and stronger clavatus muscles (the major dental plate 
      retractor) than M. glutinosa. Despite morphological differences, kinematic profiles 
      are similar in E. stoutii and M. glutinosa. When protracted, the dental plate 
      unfolds and exposes keratinous teeth, which are then embedded in the prey. Once food 
      is grasped, the dental plate is retracted into the mouth. During retraction, the 
      clavatus muscle can generate up to 16 N of force, which exceeds the bite force of 
      some gnathostomes of similar size. In addition to producing high forces with the 
      feeding muscles, hagfish can evert their dental plates to 180 degrees , exceeding 
      the gape angles attained by virtually all gnathostomes, suggesting vertebrate jaws 
      are not the prerequisites for muscle force generation and wide gapes. We propose 
      that dental plate protraction and retraction can be modeled as a fixed pulley that 
      lacks the speed amplification occurring in gnathostome jaws. Hagfish gape cycle 
      times are approximately 1 s, and are longer than those of gnathostomes, suggesting 
      that a functional advantage of jaws is the speed that allows gnathostomes to exploit 
      elusive prey.

TI  - Dropping the base: recovery from extreme hypercarbia in the CO(2) tolerant Pacific 
      hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii).
PG  - 421-435
LID - 10.1007/s00360-017-1141-2 [doi]
AB  - Hagfish are capable of tolerating extreme hypercapnia (> 30 Torr) by mounting 
      substantial plasma [HCO(3)(-)] (hypercarbia) to compensate for CO(2)-mediated 
      acidosis. The goal of this study was to characterize the mechanistic 
      hypercarbia-recovery strategies in the highly CO(2) tolerant hagfish. We exposed 
      hagfish to hypercapnia (30 Torr) for 48 h and allowed a 24 h recovery period in 
      normocapnic seawater. Within 8 h of the recovery period, the compensatory plasma 
      [HCO(3)(-)] load (~ 70 mmol L(-1)) was rapidly offloaded. While increases in both 
      whole-animal HCO(3)(-) excretion and glomerular filtration were observed throughout 
      recovery (2-8 h), neither can fully account for the observed rates of whole-animal 
      HCO(3)(-) loss, which peaked at ~ 3.5 mmol kg(-1) h(-1). Inhibition of carbonic 
      anhydrase via acetazolamide revealed that the restoration of plasma [HCO(3)(-)] from 
      hypercapnia-induced hypercarbia is likely facilitated in a dualistic manner, 
      initially relying on both carbonic anhydrase mediated CO(2) offloading and 
      Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchange processes, both of which are likely either upregulated or 
      further activated as recovery progresses.

PG  - 175-92
LID - 10.1007/978-3-319-20819-0_8 [doi]
AB  - Jawless vertebrates represented by lampreys and hagfish mount antigen-specific 
      immune responses using variable lymphocyte receptors. These receptors generate 
      diversity comparable to that of T-cell and B-cell receptors by assembling multiple 
      leucine-rich repeat modules with highly variable sequences. Although it is true that 
      jawed and jawless vertebrates have structurally unrelated antigen receptors, their 
      adaptive immune systems have much in common. Most notable is the conservation of 
      lymphocyte lineages. It appears that specialized lymphocyte lineages emerged in a 
      common vertebrate ancestor and that jawed and jawless vertebrates co-opted different 
      antigen receptors within the context of such lymphocyte lineages.

TI  - Connexins during 500 Million Years-From Cyclostomes to Mammals.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22041584 [doi]
LID - 1584
AB  - It was previously shown that the connexin gene family had relatively similar 
      subfamily structures in several vertebrate groups. Still, many details were left 
      unclear. There are essentially no data between tunicates, which have connexins that 
      cannot be divided into the classic subfamilies, and teleosts, where the subfamilies 
      are easily recognized. There are also relatively few data for the groups that 
      diverged between the teleosts and mammals. As many of the previously analyzed 
      genomes have been improved, and many more genomes are available, we reanalyzed the 
      connexin gene family and included species from all major vertebrate groups. The 
      major results can be summarized as follows: (i) The same connexin subfamily 
      structures are found in all Gnathostomata (jawed vertebrates), with some variations 
      due to genome duplications, gene duplications and gene losses. (ii) In contrast to 
      previous findings, birds do not have a lower number of connexins than other 
      tetrapods. (iii) The cyclostomes (lampreys and hagfishes) possess genes in the 
      alpha, beta, gamma and delta subfamilies, but only some of the genes show a 
      phylogenetic affinity to specific genes in jawed vertebrates. Thus, two major 
      evolutionary transformations have occurred in this gene family, from tunicates to 
      cyclostomes and from cyclostomes to jawed vertebrates.

AB  - This study examined the mechanisms of glucose acquisition in the hindgut of Pacific 
      hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii) using in vitro gut sac techniques. The intestine was 
      determined to have the capacity to digest maltose into glucose along the entirety of 
      the tract, including the foregut. Glucose uptake was biphasic and consisted of a 
      high-affinity, low-capacity concentration-dependent component conforming to 
      Michaelis-Menten kinetics (K(m) 0.37mM, J(max) 8.48nmol/cm(2)/h) as well as a 
      diffusive component. There was no observed difference in glucose flux rate along the 
      length of the intestine, similar to other nutrients investigated in the hagfish 
      intestine. A reduced sodium (<1mM) environment did not result in a change in glucose 
      uptake rates, likely due to a functional redundancy of glucose transporters. There 
      was no observed effect of phloretin, yet the sodium glucose-linked transporter 
      (SGLT)-specific inhibitor phlorizin significantly reduced glucose uptake at all 
      concentrations tested (0.0001-1mM). Additionally, the glucose transporter (GLUT) 
      inhibitor cytochalasin b significantly reduced glucose transport rates. The effects 
      of these pharmacological inhibition experiments suggest the presence of multiple 
      types of glucose transport proteins. This study clarifies the uptake strategies used 
      by hagfish to acquire glucose at the intestine and provides insight into the 
      evolution of such transport systems in early-diverging vertebrates.

TI  - The hagfish slime gland: a model system for studying the biology of mucus.
PG  - 1143-5
AB  - The hagfish slime gland may provide a model system for studying certain aspects of 
      the biology of mucus. Mucus is obtained in nonhydrated form by electrically 
      stimulating the anesthetized hagfish and the secretions are stirred into ammonium 
      sulfate. Centrifugation and filtration are than used to isolate the two major 
      secretory products, mucous vesicles and threads. Specific advantages of the model 
      and potential applications for research are discussed.

TI  - Introducing a novel mechanism to control heart rate in the ancestral Pacific 
      hagfish.
PG  - 3227-3236
AB  - Although neural modulation of heart rate is well established among chordate animals, 
      the Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii) lacks any cardiac innervation, yet it can 
      increase its heart rate from the steady, depressed heart rate seen in prolonged 
      anoxia to almost double its normal normoxic heart rate, an almost fourfold overall 
      change during the 1-h recovery from anoxia. The present study sought mechanistic 
      explanations for these regulatory changes in heart rate. We provide evidence for a 
      bicarbonate-activated, soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC)-dependent mechanism to control 
      heart rate, a mechanism never previously implicated in chordate cardiac control.

AB  - Hagfishes have been the target of commercial fisheries in many areas of the world, 
      with the catch processed for leather and for human consumption. A fishery has been 
      operating in New Zealand waters for the last six years, harvesting the bearded 
      hagfish, Eptatretus cirrhatus. The fishery has thus far been unregulated. Based on 
      samples collected dockside over a two-year period, this report expands the 
      morphometric database for this species, provides information on the size and weight 
      of the harvested animals, determines the sizes at the onset of gonadal development 
      and the minimum sizes at sexual maturation for males and females, and indicates that 
      E. cirrhatus, like most other hagfish species, has no specific breeding season. 
      Although females appear in the population at smaller sizes, the sex ratio for mature 
      animals is 1:1 and the sizes of the largest males and females are comparable. The 
      changes observed in sex ratio as a function of TL suggest differences in the timing 
      and rates of gonadal development in females versus males rather than protogyny. 
      Based on the size of the eggs, the number of eggs per female, the proportion of the 
      population that contains large eggs, and the number of postovulatory females, it is 
      clear that E. cirrhatus, like other hagfish species, are potentially vulnerable to 
      overexploitation.

TI  - Gelation of Soy Milk with Hagfish Exudate Creates a Flocculated and Fibrous 
      Emulsion- and Particle Gel.

AB  - Hagfish slime is an ultra dilute, elastic and cohesive hydrogel that deploys within 
      milliseconds in cold seawater from a glandularly secreted exudate. The slime is made 
      of long keratin-like fibers and mucin-like glycoproteins that span a network which 
      entraps water and acts as a defense mechanism against predators. Unlike other 
      hydrogels, the slime only confines water physically and is very susceptible to 
      mechanical stress, which makes it unsuitable for many processing operations and 
      potential applications. Despite its huge potential, little work has been done to 
      improve and functionalize the properties of this hydrogel. To address this 
      shortcoming, hagfish exudate was mixed with a soy protein isolate suspension (4% 
      w/v) and with a soy emulsion (commercial soy milk) to form a more stable structure 
      and combine the functionalities of a suspension and emulsion with those of the 
      hydrogel. Hagfish exudate interacted strongly with the soy systems, showing a 
      markedly increased viscoelasticity and water retention. Hagfish mucin was found to 
      induce a depletion and bridging mechanism, which caused the emulsion and suspension 
      to flocculate, making "soy slime", a cohesive and cold-set emulsion- and particle 
      gel. The flocculation network increases viscoelasticity and substantially 
      contributes to liquid retention by entrapping liquid in the additional confinements 
      between aggregated particles and protein fibers. Because the mucin-induced 
      flocculation resembles the salt- or acid-induced flocculation in tofu curd 
      production, the soy slime was cooked for comparison. The cooked soy slime was 
      similar to conventional cooked tofu, but possessed a long-range cohesiveness from 
      the fibers. The fibrous, cold-set, and curd-like structure of the soy slime 
      represents a novel way for a cold coagulation and fiber incorporation into a 
      suspension or emulsion. This mechanism could be used to efficiently gel 
      functionalized emulsions or produce novel tofu-like structured food products.

TI  - Acquisition of alanyl-alanine in an Agnathan: Characteristics of dipeptide transport 
      across the hindgut of the Pacific hagfish Eptatretus stoutii.
PG  - 1471-1479
LID - 10.1111/jfb.14168 [doi]
AB  - This study used (3) H-(L) -alanyl-(L) -alanine to demonstrate dipeptide uptake using 
      in vitro gut sacs prepared from the hindgut of the Pacific hagfish Eptatretus 
      stoutii. Concentration-dependent kinetic analysis resulted in a sigmoidal 
      distribution with a maximal (± SE) uptake rate (J(max) -like) of 70 ± 3 nmol cm(-2) 
      h(-1) and an affinity constant (K(m) -like) of 1072 ± 81 μM. Addition of high 
      alanine concentrations to transport assays did not change dipeptide transport rates, 
      indicating that hydrolysis of the dipeptide in mucosal solutions and subsequent 
      uptake via apical amino acid transporters was not occurring, which was further 
      supported by a K(m) distinct from that of amino acid transport. Transport occurred 
      independent of mucosal pH, but uptake was reduced by 42% in low mucosal sodium. This 
      may implicate cooperation between peptide transporters and sodium-proton exchangers, 
      previously demonstrated in several mammalian and teleost species. Finally, apical 
      (L) -alanyl-(L) -alanine uptake rates (i.e., mucosal disappearance) were 
      significantly increased following a meal, demonstrating regulation of uptake. 
      Overall, this examination of dipeptide acquisition in the earliest extant Agnathan 
      suggests evolutionarily conserved mechanisms of transport between hagfish and 
      later-diverging vertebrates such as teleosts and mammals.

TI  - Hagfish and lancelet fibrillar collagens reveal that type II collagen-based 
      cartilage evolved in stem vertebrates.
PG  - 16829-33
AB  - The origin of vertebrates was defined by evolution of a skeleton; however, little is 
      known about the developmental mechanisms responsible for this landmark evolutionary 
      innovation. In jawed vertebrates, cartilage matrix consists predominantly of type II 
      collagen (Col2alpha1), whereas that of jawless fishes has long been thought to be 
      noncollagenous. We recently showed that Col2alpha1 is present in lamprey cartilage, 
      indicating that type II collagen-based cartilage evolved earlier than previously 
      recognized. Here, we investigate the origin of vertebrate cartilage, and we report 
      that hagfishes, the sister group to lampreys, also have Col2alpha1-based cartilage, 
      suggesting its presence in the common ancestor of crown-group vertebrates. We go on 
      to show that lancelets, a sister group to vertebrates, possess an ancestral clade A 
      fibrillar collagen (ColA) gene that is expressed in the notochord. Together, these 
      results suggest that duplication and diversification of ColA genes at the 
      chordate-vertebrate transition may underlie the evolutionary origin of vertebrate 
      skeletal tissues.

TI  - Identification of a functional corpus luteum in the Atlantic hagfish, Myxine 
      glutinosa.
PG  - 95-101
AB  - Hagfish represent the oldest extant craniates and are an important link between 
      invertebrates and vertebrates. However, key elements of the reproductive system have 
      not been elucidated in hagfish. There is new evidence from our recent studies that 
      Atlantic hagfish may have a seasonal reproductive cycle. These data include seasonal 
      changes in gonadotropin-releasing hormone, gonadal steroids, estradiol, and 
      progesterone, corresponding to gonadal reproductive stages along with the putative 
      identification of a functional corpus luteum. The corpus luteum in non-mammalian 
      vertebrates secretes mainly progesterone thought to be involved in the retention of 
      eggs and down regulation of vitellogenin synthesis. The most ancient vertebrate that 
      is known to have a functional corpus luteum is the dogfish, Squalus acanthias. 
      However, brown bodies, hypothesized to be corpora lutea, have been observed by 
      scientists for over 100 years in the gonad of the hagfish. To date, data in support 
      of these brown bodies acting as corpora lutea have consisted mainly of observational 
      studies. Therefore, we examined the putative corpora lutea (post-ovulatory 
      follicles) in hagfish by histology, electron microscopy, and production of 
      progesterone and estradiol. Progesterone concentrations from post-ovulatory 
      follicles were significantly higher (12+/-1.5 pg/mg gonad tissue wet weight) 
      compared to controls containing only gonadal tissues and oocytes (3.6+/-1.5 pg/mg 
      gonad tissue wet weight) (p<0.05). Estradiol was detected in seven of the 13 samples 
      containing only gonadal tissue with oocytes and ranged between 0.6 and 0.18 pg/mg 
      gonad tissue wet weight and was not detected in any of the media containing only 
      corpora lutea samples. Light and electron microscopy analysis supported that these 
      structures were corpora lutea like structures (post-ovulatory follicles). From these 
      results, we hypothesize that hagfish have functional corpora lutea like structures 
      that produce progesterone.

TI  - Hagfish hemoglobins: structure, function, and oxygen-linked association.
PG  - 27415-23
AB  - Cyclostomes, hagfishes and lampreys, contain hemoglobins that are monomeric when 
      oxygenated and polymerize to dimers or tetramers when deoxygenated. The three major 
      hemoglobin components (HbI, HbII, and HbIII) from the hagfish Myxine glutinosa have 
      been characterized and compared with lamprey Petromyzon marinus HbV, whose x-ray 
      crystal structure has been solved in the deoxygenated, dimeric state (Heaslet, H. 
      A., and Royer, W. E., Jr. (1999) Structure 7, 517-526). Of these three, HbII bears 
      the highest sequence similarity to P. marinus HbV. In HbI and HbIII the distal 
      histidine is substituted by a glutamine residue and additional substitutions occur 
      in residues located at the deoxy dimer interface of P. marinus HbV. Infrared 
      spectroscopy of the CO derivatives, used to probe the distal pocket fine structure, 
      brings out a correlation between the CO stretching frequencies and the rates of CO 
      combination. Ultracentrifugation studies show that HbI and HbIII are monomeric in 
      both the oxygenated and deoxygenated states under all conditions studied, whereas 
      deoxy HbII forms dimers at acidic pH values, like P. marinus HbV. Accordingly, the 
      oxygen affinities of HbI and HbIII are independent of pH, whereas HbII displays a 
      Bohr effect below pH 7.2. HbII also forms heterodimers with HbIII and 
      heterotetramers with HbI. The functional counterparts of heteropolymer formation are 
      cooperativity in oxygen binding and the oxygen-linked binding of protons and 
      bicarbonate. The observed effects are explained on the basis of the x-ray structure 
      of P. marinus HbV and the association behavior of site-specific mutants (Qiu, Y., 
      Maillett, D. H., Knapp, J., Olson, J. S., and Riggs, A. F. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 
      275, 13517-13528).

TI  - The neural crest and origin of the neurocranium in vertebrates.
PG  - e23213
LID - 10.1002/dvg.23213 [doi]
AB  - Cranium of jawed vertebrates is composed of dorsal moiety that encapsulates the 
      brain, or the neurocranium, and the is called the neurocranium, and the ventral 
      moiety, the viscerocranium, that supports the pharynx. In modern jawed vertebrates 
      (crown gnathostomes), the viscerocranium is predominantly of neural crest origin, 
      and for the neurocranium, the rostral part is derived from neural crest cells, 
      whereas the posterior part from the mesoderm. In the cyclostome cranium, the 
      mesoderm/neural crest boundary of the neurocranium used to be enigmatic, let alone 
      the morphological comparison of neurocranial between two cyclostome groups, lampreys 
      and hagfishes. By examining the hagfish development it has become clear that 
      cyclostomes share a common craniofacial embryonic pattern that is not shared by 
      modern gnathostomes, and cyclostome cranium can be compared among the group as 
      developmental modular units with comparable mesoderm/neural crest boundary within 
      the neuroranium. Also, the dual origin of the jawed vertebrate neurocranium has now 
      turned out to represent a derived condition, and ancestrally, the neurocranium would 
      likely have been predominantly of mesodermal origin. Enlargement of the forebrain 
      and reorganization of the oral apparatus seem to have led to the involvement of the 
      neural crest in the rostral neurocranium.

TI  - Hagfish biopolymer: a type I/type II homologue of epidermal keratin intermediate 
      filaments.
PG  - 283-92
AB  - In contrast to most intermediate filaments (IF) which function intracellularly or 
      constitute epidermal appendages, the single massive (approximately 60 cm length, 
      approximately 3 microns width) IF-rich 'thread' biopolymer synthesized by the 
      specialized hagfish gland thread cell is released extracellularly via holocrine 
      secretion to interact with mucins and seawater, thereby modifying the viscoelastic 
      properties of the copious mucous exudate. Recently, using the Pacific hagfish 
      (Eptatretus stouti, class Agnatha), a jawless scaleless marine vertebrate of ancient 
      lineage, we determined that the deduced amino acid sequence of one thread IF chain 
      (alpha, 66.6 kDa, native pI 7.5) contained an atypical, threonine-rich central rod 
      domain of low identity (< 30%) with other vertebrate IF types, but that the N- and 
      C-terminal domains exhibited several keratin-like features. From these and other 
      unexpected characteristics, it was concluded that hagfish alpha is best categorized 
      as a type II homologue of an epidermal keratin. We now report the deduced sequence 
      of a second thread IF subunit (gamma, 62.7 kDa, native pI 5.3) which is co-expressed 
      and co-assembles in vitro with alpha in a 1:1 ratio. As was found for alpha, the N- 
      and C-terminal domains of gamma have keratin-like parameters, but the central rod 
      has low identity to IFs of types I-V (< 31%), a cephalochordate IF (< 29%) and 
      invertebrate IFs (< 20%) and no particular homology to type I or type II keratins. 
      Central rod identity between gamma and alpha is also low (approximately 23%), as is 
      typical of comparisons between different rod types but atypical of similar rod types 
      (> 50%). The central rods of both gamma and alpha lack the 42-residue insert of 
      helix 1B present in lamins and invertebrate IFs, have unusually high threonine 
      contents (gamma, 10%; alpha, 13%) compared to other IF types (2-5%), contain a 
      number of unexpected residues in consensus conserved sites, and employ a L12 segment 
      of 21 residues rather than the 16 or 17 residues found in keratins. Theoretical 
      analyses indicate that the hagfish molecules exist as coiled coil heterodimers 
      (alpha/gamma) in which the chains are parallel, in axial register, and stabilized by 
      significant numbers of ionic interactions. Fast Fourier-transform analyses revealed 
      that the linear distribution period of approximately 9.55 for basic and acidic 
      residues in other IF chains is not completely maintained, partly due to the high 
      threonine content. The threonine residues occupy mainly outer sites b, c, f in the 
      heptad substructure, possibly abetting parallel alignment of thousands of IFs within 
      the thread, interactions with mucins at the thread periphery, and hierarchical IF 
      chain assembly. It is suggested that the gamma and alpha chains from this most 
      primitive extant vertebrate are type I and type II homologues of epidermal keratin 
      chains, possibly related to early specialized keratins.

TI  - Stabilization and swelling of hagfish slime mucin vesicles.
PG  - 1092-9
LID - 10.1242/jeb.038992 [doi]
AB  - When agitated, Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) produce large quantities of slime 
      that consists of hydrated bundles of protein filaments and membrane-bound mucin 
      vesicles from numerous slime glands. When the slime exudate contacts seawater, the 
      thread bundles unravel and the mucin vesicles swell and rupture. Little is known 
      about the mechanisms of vesicle rupture in seawater and stabilization within the 
      gland, although it is believed that the vesicle membrane is permeable to most ions 
      except polyvalent anions. We hypothesized that the most abundant compounds within 
      the slime gland exudate have a stabilizing effect on the mucin vesicles. To test 
      this hypothesis, we measured the chemical composition of the fluid component of 
      hagfish slime exudate and conducted functional assays with these solutes to test 
      their ability to keep the vesicles in a condensed state. We found K(+) 
      concentrations that were elevated relative to plasma, and Na(+), Cl(-) and Ca(2+) 
      concentrations that were considerably lower. Our analysis also revealed high levels 
      of methylamines such as trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), betaine and dimethylglycine, 
      which had a combined concentration of 388 mmol l(-1) in the glandular fluid. In 
      vitro rupture assays demonstrated that both TMAO and betaine had a significant 
      effect on rupture, but neither was capable of completely abolishing mucin swelling 
      and rupture, even at high concentrations. This suggests that some other mechanism 
      such as the chemical microenvironment within gland mucous cells, or hydrostatic 
      pressure is responsible for stabilization of the vesicles within the gland.

TI  - The effects of salinity and hypoxia exposure on oxygen consumption, ventilation,

      stoutii).

AB  - Hagfishes (Class: Myxini) are marine jawless craniate fishes that are widely 
      considered to be osmoconformers whose plasma [Na(+)], [Cl(-)] and osmolality closely 
      resemble that of sea water, although they have the ability to regulate plasma 
      [Ca(2+)] and [Mg(2+)] below seawater levels. We investigated the responses of 
      Pacific hagfish to changes in respiratory and ionoregulatory demands imposed by a 
      48-h exposure to altered salinity (25 ppt, 30 ppt (control) and 35 ppt) and by an 
      acute hypoxia exposure (30 Torr; 4 kPa). When hagfish were exposed to 25 ppt, oxygen 
      consumption rate (MO(2)), ammonia excretion rate (J(amm)) and unidirectional 
      diffusive water flux rate (J(H2O), measured with (3)H(2)O) were all reduced, 
      pointing to an interaction between ionoregulation and gas exchange. At 35 ppt, 
      J(H2O) was reduced, though MO(2) and J(amm) did not change. As salinity increased, 
      so did the difference between plasma and external water [Ca(2+)] and [Mg(2+)]. 
      Notably, the same pattern was seen for plasma Cl(-), which was kept below seawater 
      [Cl(-)] at all salinities, while plasma [Na(+)] was regulated well above seawater 
      [Na(+)], but plasma osmolality matched seawater values. MO(2) was reduced by 49% and 
      J(H2O) by 36% during hypoxia, despite a small elevation in overall ventilation. Our 
      results depart from the "classical" osmorespiratory compromise but are in accord 
      with responses in other hypoxia-tolerant fish; instead of an exacerbation of gill 
      fluxes when gas transfer is upregulated, the opposite happens.

AB  - Hagfish slime threads, which make up the fibrous component of the defensive slime of 
      hagfishes, consist primarily of proteins from the intermediate filament family of 
      proteins and possess impressive mechanical properties that make them attractive 
      biomimetic models. To investigate whether solubilized intermediate filament proteins 
      can be used to make high-performance, environmentally sustainable materials, we cast 
      thin films on the surface of electrolyte buffers using solubilized hagfish slime 
      thread proteins. The films were drawn into fibers, and the tensile properties were 
      measured. Fiber mechanics depended on casting conditions and postspinning 
      processing. Postsecondary drawing resulted in fibers with improved material 
      properties similar to those of regenerated silk fibers. Structural analyses of the 
      fibers revealed increased molecular alignment resulting from the second draw, but no 
      increase in crystallinity. Our findings show promise for intermediate filament 
      proteins as an alternative source for the design and production of high performance 
      protein-based fibers.

TI  - Three-dimensional structure of the nasal passageway of a hagfish and its 
      implications for olfaction.
PG  - 1045-56
LID - 10.1002/ar.21382 [doi]
AB  - From high-resolution (65 μm) data acquired by magnetic resonance imaging, we have 
      reconstructed the nasal passageway of a single adult hagfish specimen (probably 
      Eptatretus stoutii). We have used this reconstruction to investigate how the anatomy 
      and morphometry of the nasal passageway influence the olfactory ability of the 
      hagfish. We found that the long, broad section of the passageway preceding the nasal 
      chamber will delay the response to an odor by 1-2 s. Diffusion of odorant to the 
      olfactory epithelium, on which the olfactory sensitivity of an animal depends, will 
      be favored by the relatively large surface area of the olfactory epithelium (∼140 
      mm(2) ) and a modest expansion in the nasal chamber. Oscillating flow (0.3-0.4 Hz) 
      within the narrow (65-130 μm) sensory channels of the nasal chamber is laminar 
      (Reynolds number ∼ 5) and quasi-steady (Womersley number generally less than one). 
      Distribution of flow over the olfactory epithelium may be aided by: (a) a narrowing 
      before the nasal chamber; (b) partial blockage of the nasal passageway by a 
      protrusion on the central olfactory lamella; and (c) the inward inclination of the 
      olfactory lamellae.

TI  - Acute temperature effects on metabolic rate, ventilation, diffusive water exchange, 
      osmoregulation, and acid-base status in the Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii).
PG  - 17-35
LID - 10.1007/s00360-018-1191-0 [doi]
AB  - The Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii) is a representative of the most basal 
      extant craniates, and is a marine osmoconformer with an extremely low metabolic rate 
      (MO(2) = 475 µmol O(2)/kg/h at 12 °C). We investigated potential physiological 
      trade-offs associated with compensatory changes in gill ventilation and perfusion 
      when 12 °C-acclimated hagfish were acutely exposed to 7 °C or 17 °C, as reflected in 
      diffusive unidirectional water flux ([Formula: see text], measured with tritiated 
      water: (3)H(2)O), net ammonia flux (J(amm)), and plasma ion and acid-base status. 
      [Formula: see text] was high (~ 1.4 L/kg/h at 12 °C) in comparison to marine 
      teleosts and elasmobranchs. MO(2) increased linearly with temperature 
      (R(2) = 0.991), and was more sensitive (Q(10) = 3.22) in the 12-7 °C range than 
      either J(amm) (1.86) or [Formula: see text] (1.35), but the pattern reversed from 12 
      to 17 °C (Q(10)s: MO(2) = 2.77, J(amm) = 2.88, [Formula: see text] = 4.01). Heart 
      rate, ventilatory index (a proxy for total ventilation), and coughing frequency also 
      increased but with different patterns. At 17 °C, plasma [Ca(2+)] and [Mg(2+)] 
      decreased, although osmolality increased, associated with elevations in plasma 
      [Na(+)] and [Cl(-)]. Blood pH and PCO(2) were unaffected by acute temperature 
      changes while [HCO(3)(-)] increased. Hyperoxia (PO(2) > 300 Torr) attenuated the 
      increase in [Formula: see text] at 17 °C, did not affect J(amm), and had diverse 
      effects on plasma ion and acid-base status. Our results suggest a clear 
      osmorespiratory compromise occurring for the diffusive water fluxes as a result of 
      acute temperature changes in this osmoconformer.

TI  - Composition, morphology and mechanics of hagfish slime.
PG  - 4613-25
AB  - Hagfish slime consists of mucins and protein threads that are released from slime 
      glands and mix with seawater to produce an ephemeral material with intriguing 
      physical properties. We recently characterized the mechanics of the slime's fibrous 
      component, and here we report the first mechanical properties of the mucin component 
      and the slime as a whole. Our results suggest that hagfishes can produce remarkable 
      quantities of the slime because it is almost three orders of magnitude more dilute 
      than typical mucus secretions. Mechanical experiments using whole slime produced in 
      vitro demonstrate that the slime threads dominate the slime's material properties 
      and impart elasticity. Mucins impart viscosity at the strain rates tested and are 
      important for rapid deployment of the slime. We also found that slime threads are 
      tapered at both ends, which suggested to us that hagfish slime might best be modeled 
      as a discontinuous fibre-reinforced composite. Our measurements demonstrate that the 
      mucins are not capable of providing shear linkage between threads, but this is not 
      necessary because the threads are long enough to span an entire slime mass. Our 
      findings suggest that hagfish slime consists mainly of bulk seawater entrained 
      between mucin-coated threads, and in this way functions more like a fine sieve than 
      coherent mucus. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the slime has 
      evolved as a defense against gill-breathing predators.

AB  - Jawless vertebrates have an alternative adaptive immune system mediated by variable 
      lymphocyte receptors (VLRs), VLRA, VLRC and VLRB. In investigation on the adaptive 
      immunity of hagfish, avian influenza virus hemagglutinin (H9N2-HA1) was used as a 
      model antigen, with mRNA expression levels of VLRA, VLRC and Ikaros were 
      up-regulated in the first week post-immunization. CD45 was up-regulated after the 
      first week; and expression of VLRB progressively increased over the course of the 
      trial. The transcriptional/translational activation of VLRB in blood was verified. 
      The VLRBs cloned from these transcripts showed diversity in their leucine-rich 
      repeats (LRRs). The production of specific VLRB increased in a time- and 
      dose-dependent manner, detected by an anti-VLRB antibody (11G5). The plasma VLRB 
      could distinguish H9N2-HA1 from unrelated proteins, but not from other HA1 subtypes. 
      Together, our findings show that VLRs play a major role in the alternative adaptive 
      immune system of hagfish by responding to specific foreign substances, such as 
      H9N2-HA1.

AB  - Modern vertebrates consist of two sister groups: cyclostomes and gnathostomes. 
      Cyclostomes are a monophyletic jawless group that can be further divided into 
      hagfishes and lampreys, which show conspicuously different developmental and 
      morphological patterns. However, during early pharyngula development, there appears 
      to be a stage when the embryos of hagfishes and lampreys resemble each other by 
      showing an "ancestral" craniofacial pattern; this pattern enables morphological 
      comparison of hagfish and lamprey craniofacial development at late stages. This 
      cyclostome developmental pattern, or more accurately, this developmental pattern of 
      the jawless grade of vertebrates in early pharyngula was very likely shared by the 
      gnathostome stem before the division of the nasohypophyseal placode led to the jaw 
      and paired nostrils. The craniofacial pattern of the modern jawed vertebrates seems 
      to have begun in fossil ostracoderms (including galeaspids), and was completed by 
      the early placoderm lineages. The transition from jawless to jawed vertebrates was 
      thus driven by heterotopy of development, mainly caused by separation and shift of 
      ectodermal placodes and resultant ectomesenchymal distribution, and shifts of the 
      epithelial-mesenchymal interactions that underlie craniofacial differentiation. 
      Thus, the evolution of the jaw was not a simple modification of the mandibular arch, 
      but a heterotopic shift of the developmental interactions involving not only the 
      mandibular arch, but also the premandibular region rostral to the mandibular arch.

PG  - 204-14
AB  - The fine structure of spermatid differentiation in a primitive vertebrate, the 
      hagfish, whose spermatozoa bear acrosomes, was investigated. In early round 
      spermatids, the acrosomal vesicles were spherical and located in a shallow nuclear 
      indentation, flanked by the plasma and the nuclear membranes. The vesicle underwent 
      a transition through lens-shaped and cap-shaped stages until it attained the shape 
      of a bell in mature spermatozoa. Electron-dense acrosomal material that appeared as 
      deposits in three portions of the vesicle finally joined in the center region at a 
      late stage. Condensation of chromatin occurred in the anterior region of the 
      nucleus. During transformation of the spermatids, many regularly spaced microtubules 
      appeared beneath the plasma membrane except in the anteriormost region of the cell. 
      The microtubules in a single alignment lay parallel to one another and encased the 
      nucleus diagonally. During an early stage, the centrioles changed their orientation 
      from perpendicular to longitudinal and rotated to become parallel to the long axis 
      of the nucleus. Thus, the flagellum lay nearly straight along the cell axis. A 
      cytoplasmic canal appeared transiently during the early stage. A droplet of 
      cytoplasm was eliminated after descending along the flagella. The features of 
      spermiogenesis in hagfish, which lies between invertebrates and vertebrates, are 
      compared with those of other animals.

      connection and the ventral aorta.

AB  - We have studied the heart in three species of hagfish: Myxine glutinosa, Eptatretus 
      stoutii, and Eptatretus cirrhatus and report about the morphology of the ventricle, 
      the arterial connection and the ventral aorta. On the whole, the hagfish heart lacks 
      outflow tract components, the ventricle and atrium adopt a dorso-caudal rather than 
      a ventro-dorsal relationship, and the sinus venosus opens into the left side of the 
      atrium. This may indicate a "defective" cardiac looping during embryogenesis. The 
      ventral aorta is elongated in M. glutinosa and E. stoutii but sac-like in E. 
      cirrhatus. The ventricles are entirely trabeculated. The myocytes show a low 
      myofibrillar content and junctional complexes formed by fascia adherens and 
      desmosomes. Gap junctions could not be demonstrated. Myocardial cells in M. 
      glutinosa contain numerous lipid droplets. These droplets are less numerous in E. 
      stoutii and practically absent in E. cirrhatus, suggesting different metabolic 
      requirements. Other cell types present in the ventricle are chromaffin cells and 
      granular leukocytes that contain rod-shaped granules. The ventricle-aorta connection 
      is guarded by a bicuspid valve with left and right, pocket-like leaflets. The 
      leaflets extend from the cranial end of the ventricle into the aorta but the 
      junction is asymmetrical. This junction contains a ganglion-like structure in E. 
      cirrhatus. The ventral aorta shows endothelial, media, and adventitial layers. The 
      media contains smooth muscle cells surrounded by dense bands formed by 
      tightly-packed extracellular filaments. In addition, a short number of elastic 
      fibers are observed in M. glutinosa and E. stoutii. Cellular and extracellular 
      elements are more loosely organized in the aorta of E. cirrhatus. The collagenous 
      adventitia contains ganglion-like cells in the three species. In the absence of 
      nerves, chromaffin and ganglion-like cells may control the activity of the 
      myocardium and that of the aortic smooth muscle cells, respectively.

AB  - The neuroendocrine mechanism underlying stress responses in vertebrates is 
      hypothesized to be highly conserved and evolutionarily ancient. Indeed, elements of 
      this mechanism, from the brain to steroidogenic tissue, are present in all 
      vertebrate groups; yet, evidence of the function and even identity of some elements 
      of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal/interrenal (HPA/I) axis is equivocal among the 
      most basal vertebrates. The purpose of this review is to discuss the functional 
      evolution of the HPA/I axis in vertebrates with a focus on our understanding of this 
      neuroendocrine mechanism in the most ancient vertebrates: the agnathan (i.e., 
      hagfish and lamprey) and chondrichthyan fishes (i.e., sharks, rays, and chimeras). A 
      review of the current literature presents evidence of a conserved HPA/I axis in 
      jawed vertebrates (i.e., gnathostomes); yet, available data in jawless (i.e., 
      agnathan) and chondrichthyan fishes are limited. Neuroendocrine regulation of 
      corticosteroidogenesis in agnathans and chondrichthyans appears to function through 
      similar pathways as in bony fishes and tetrapods; however, key elements have yet to 
      be identified and the involvement of melanotropins and gonadotropin-releasing 
      hormone in the stress axis in these ancient fishes warrants further investigation. 
      Further, the identities of physiological glucocorticoids are uncertain in hagfishes, 
      chondrichthyans, and even coelacanths. Resolving these and other knowledge gaps in 
      the stress response of ancient fishes will be significant for advancing knowledge of 
      the evolutionary origins of the vertebrate stress response.

TI  - The effects of variable water salinity and ionic composition on the plasma status of 
      the Pacific Hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii).
PG  - 721-8
LID - 10.1007/s00360-009-0355-3 [doi]
AB  - Hagfish are the most pleisiomorphic extant craniates, and based on the similarity of 
      ionic concentrations between their internal milieu and seawater (SW), they have long 
      been touted as a model for osmo- and ionoconformation. As a result, the lack of 
      direct symmetry between hagfish plasma and the environment with respect to [Na(+)], 
      [Cl(-)], [Mg(2+)], and [Ca(2+)] have been left largely unexplored. In order to 
      determine the capacity of hagfish to regulate their blood compartment, we exposed 
      Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii) to 24, 32, 40, and 48 g/l salinity for 48 h, as 
      well as to two treatments where a portion of the water [Na(+)] was replaced with 
      either Mg(2+) or Ca(2+) at constant salinity for up to 6 days. Following exposure, 
      we measured plasma ion status, pH, and total carbon dioxide (TCO(2)). As expected, 
      our results indicated that hagfish had no capacity to regulate plasma osmolality, 
      [Na(+)], or [Cl(-)], but they did maintain plasma [Mg(2+)] and [Ca(2+)] nearly 
      constant despite fluctuation of environmental salinity or elevated water [Mg(2+)] 
      and [Ca(2+)] (two- and sevenfold, respectively). Furthermore, exposure to elevated 
      water [Mg(2+)] and [Ca(2+)] resulted in a large increase of plasma TCO(2) with 
      little to no increase of plasma pH. We concluded that hagfish may control plasma 
      [Mg(2+)] and [Ca(2+)] at levels below that of their environment via secretion of 
      HCO(3) (-), similar to the mechanisms described in the intestine of teleosts. We 
      speculate that secretion of HCO(3) (-) likely evolved to maintain plasma [Mg(2+)] 
      and [Ca(2+)] below environmental levels (both of which negatively affect nervous 
      function and muscle contraction if elevated), and was an exaptation for the 
      development of water-absorption mechanisms in the intestine of marine 
      osmoregulators. The ancestors of modern hagfish are thought to have never entered 
      freshwater, thus investigations into their ionoregulatory ability potentially have 
      profound implications regarding the evolution of fishes.

TI  - microRNAs reveal the interrelationships of hagfish, lampreys, and gnathostomes and 
      the nature of the ancestral vertebrate.
PG  - 19379-83
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1010350107 [doi]
AB  - Hagfish and lampreys are the only living representatives of the jawless vertebrates 
      (agnathans), and compared with jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes), they provide 
      insight into the embryology, genomics, and body plan of the ancestral vertebrate. 
      However, this insight has been obscured by controversy over their 
      interrelationships. Morphological cladistic analyses have identified lampreys and 
      gnathostomes as closest relatives, whereas molecular phylogenetic studies recover a 
      monophyletic Cyclostomata (hagfish and lampreys as closest relatives). Here, we show 
      through deep sequencing of small RNA libraries, coupled with genomic surveys, that 
      Cyclostomata is monophyletic: hagfish and lampreys share 4 unique microRNA families, 
      15 unique paralogues of more primitive microRNA families, and 22 unique 
      substitutions to the mature gene products. Reanalysis of morphological data reveals 
      that support for cyclostome paraphyly was based largely on incorrect character 
      coding, and a revised dataset is not decisive on the mono- vs. paraphyly of 
      cyclostomes. Furthermore, we show fundamental conservation of microRNA expression 
      patterns among lamprey, hagfish, and gnathostome organs, implying that the role of 
      microRNAs within specific organs is coincident with their appearance within the 
      genome and is conserved through time. Together, these data support the monophyly of 
      cyclostomes and suggest that the last common ancestor of all living vertebrates was 
      a more complex organism than conventionally accepted by comparative morphologists 
      and developmental biologists.

TI  - Coiling and maturation of a high-performance fibre in hagfish slime gland thread 
      cells.
PG  - 3534
LID - 10.1038/ncomms4534 [doi]
AB  - The defensive slime of hagfishes contains thousands of intermediate filament protein 
      threads that are manufactured within specialized gland thread cells. The material 
      properties of these threads rival those of spider dragline silks, which makes them 
      an ideal model for biomimetic efforts to produce sustainable protein materials, yet 
      how the thread is produced and organized within the cell is not well understood. 
      Here we show how changes in nuclear morphology, size and position can explain the 
      three-dimensional pattern of thread coiling in gland thread cells, and how the 
      ultrastructure of the thread changes as very young thread cells develop into large 
      cells with fully mature coiled threads. Our model provides an explanation for the 
      complex process of thread assembly and organization that has fascinated and 
      perplexed biologists for over a century, and provides valuable insights for the 
      quest to manufacture high-performance biomimetic protein materials.

TI  - Evidence for independent Hox gene duplications in the hagfish lineage: a PCR-based 
      gene inventory of Eptatretus stoutii.
PG  - 686-94
AB  - Hox genes code for transcription factors that play a major role in the development 
      of all animal phyla. In invertebrates these genes usually occur as tightly linked 
      cluster, with a few exceptions where the clusters have been dissolved. Only in 
      vertebrates multiple clusters have been demonstrated which arose by duplication from 
      a single ancestral cluster. This history of Hox cluster duplications, in particular 
      during the early elaboration of the vertebrate body plan, is still poorly 
      understood. In this paper we report the results of a PCR survey on genomic DNA of 
      the pacific hagfish Eptatretus stoutii. Hagfishes are one of two clades of recent 
      jawless fishes that are an offshoot of the early radiation of jawless vertebrates. 
      Our data provide evidence for at least 33 distinct Hox genes in the hagfish genome, 
      which is most compatible with the hypothesis of multiple Hox clusters. The largest 
      number, seven, of distinct homeobox fragments could be assigned to paralog group 9, 
      which could imply that the hagfish has more than four clusters. Quartet mapping 
      reveals that within each paralog group the hagfish sequences are statistically more 
      closely related to gnathostome Hox genes than with either amphioxus or lamprey 
      genes. These results support two assumptions about the history of Hox genes: (1) The 
      association of hagfish homeobox sequences with gnathostome sequences suggests that 
      at least one Hox cluster duplication event happened in the stem of vertebrates, 
      i.e., prior to the most recent common ancestor of jawed and jawless vertebrates. (2) 
      The high number of paralog group 9 sequences in hagfish and the phylogenetic 
      position of hagfish suggests that the hagfish lineage underwent additional 
      independent Hox cluster/-gene duplication events.

AB  - The structure-activity relations of myxinidin, a peptide derived from epidermal 
      mucus of hagfish, Myxine glutinosa L., were investigated. Analysis of key residues 
      allowed us to design new peptides with increased efficiency. Antimicrobial activity 
      of native and modified peptides demonstrated the key role of uncharged residues in 
      the sequence; the loss of these residues reduces almost entirely myxinidin 
      antimicrobial activity, while insertion of arginine at charged and uncharged 
      position increases antimicrobial activity compared with that of native myxinidin. 
      Particularly, we designed a peptide capable of achieving a high inhibitory effect on 
      bacterial growth. Experiments were conducted using both Gram-negative and 
      Gram-positive bacteria. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies showed that 
      myxinidin is able to form an amphipathic α-helical structure at the N terminus and a 
      random coil region at the C terminus.

TI  - Design principles of adaptive immune systems.
PG  - 307-17
LID - 10.1038/nri2944 [doi]
AB  - Both jawless vertebrates, such as lampreys and hagfish, and jawed vertebrates 
      (encompassing species as diverse as sharks and humans) have an adaptive immune 
      system that is based on somatically diversified and clonally expressed antigen 
      receptors. Although the molecular nature of the antigen receptors and the mechanisms 
      of their assembly are different, recent findings suggest that the general design 
      principles underlying the two adaptive immune systems are surprisingly similar. The 
      identification of such commonalities promises to further our understanding of the 
      mammalian immune system and to inspire the development of new strategies for medical 
      interventions targeting the consequences of faulty immune functions.

TI  - Determining the functional role of waterborne amino acid uptake in hagfish 
      nutrition: a constitutive pathway when fasting or a supplementary pathway when 
      feeding?
PG  - 843-53
LID - 10.1007/s00360-016-1004-2 [doi]
AB  - Hagfish are unique among aquatic "vertebrates" in their ability to absorb amino 
      acids directly from the water via skin and gill epithelia, but it is unknown whether 
      this phenomenon extends beyond a few studied substrates; what effect fed state has 
      on absorption; and what functional role this may play in hagfish nutrition. Using in 
      vivo and in vitro transport assays, uptake and tissue distribution of the waterborne 
      amino acids L-alanine, L-lysine, and L-phenylalanine were examined as a function of 
      fed state. All three amino acids were shown to be taken up from the water (lysine 
      and phenylalanine for the first time). Following immersion in radiolabelled 
      solutions for 24 h, phenylalanine was the amino acid that accumulated at the highest 
      levels in almost all tissues, with the highest accumulation noted in red blood cells 
      and bile, followed by gill and liver. In general, tissues of fed hagfish displayed a 
      significantly reduced phenylalanine accumulation compared to tissues of hagfish 
      fasted for 3 weeks. An in vitro assay showed that phenylalanine was transported 
      across the skin at the highest rate, with the uptake of lysine occurring at the 
      lowest rate. Feeding status had no significant effect on in vitro transport. These 
      data indicate that dissolved organic nutrients are a significant source of nutrition 
      to hagfish, and may be relatively more important during periods of fasting than 
      during periods of feeding when immersed in decaying carcasses.

TI  - cDNA cloning of a mannose-binding lectin-associated serine protease (MASP) gene from 
      hagfish (Eptatretus burgeri).
PG  - 897-904
AB  - Hagfish, agnathan cyclostome, is the most primitive extant vertebrate and its 
      complement (C) system seems to be a primordial system in comparison with a 
      well-developed C system in gnathostome vertebrates. From a phylogenic perspective of 
      defense mechanisms, we have isolated complement C3 from the serum of hagfish 
      (Eptatretus burgeri). In this study, we first attempted to identify a hagfish Bf or 
      C2 as a C3 convertase by RT-PCR using degenerative primers designed on the basis of 
      the conserved amino acid stretches among the several kinds of serine proteases. 
      Contrary to our expectation, homology search of cloned RT-PCR product suggested that 
      there was a partial cDNA encoding the homologue of neither Bf nor C2 but a 
      mannose-binding lectin-associated serine protease (MASP). Analyses of a full-length 
      cDNA clone isolated from a hagfish liver cDNA library by using the partial cDNA as a 
      probe indicated that this cDNA encoded hagfish MASP 1. This evidence strongly 
      suggests that the hagfish defends itself against pathogens at least by the 
      complement system composed of lectin pathway.

TI  - Distribution of immunoreactive adenohypophysial cell types in the pituitaries of the 
      Atlantic and the Pacific hagfish, Myxine glutinosa and Eptatretus burgeri.
PG  - 142-50
AB  - The hagfish is considered the most primitive vertebrate known, living or extinct. It 
      remains an enigma whether adenohypophysial hormones similar to those of more 
      advanced vertebrates are present in the hagfish pituitary gland or not. The present 
      study aimed to detect immunoreactive adenohypophysial hormones in the hagfish 
      pituitary gland, using antisera to tetrapod and fish adenohypophysial hormones as 
      immunohistochemical probes. For this purpose, two species of hagfish, the Atlantic 
      hagfish, Myxine glutinosa, and the Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri, were used. 
      In both species, three different types of immunoreactive cells were detected in the 
      adenohypophysis. (1) The first type of cells was gonadotropin (GTH)-like cells which 
      were stained by antisera to LH-related GTHs, such as ovine LHbeta, human LHbeta, 
      bullfrog LH, salmon LHbeta and sturgeon LHbeta in both species of hagfish. (2) The 
      second type of cells that were detected was growth hormone (GH)/prolactin (PRL)-like 
      cells. In M. glutinosa the cells were stained by antisera to salmon GH, salmon PRL, 
      sturgeon GH, sturgeon PRL, blue shark GH, and lamprey GH. In E. burgeri the cells 
      were only stained by anti-human GH and anti-sturgeon PRL. (3) The last type of cells 
      was adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)-like cells. These cells were stained by antisera to 
      lamprey ACTH and human beta-endorphin. In both species of hagfish, GTH-like cells 
      were relatively abundant, and were distributed throughout the adenohypophysis, 
      whereas GH/PRL-like and ACTH-like cells were few in number in the adenohypophysis. 
      Based on these findings, we suggest that hagfish may have retained ancestral 
      characteristics of key anterior pituitary hormones.

TI  - Handed behavior in hagfish--an ancient vertebrate lineage--and a survey of 
      lateralized behaviors in other invertebrate chordates and elongate vertebrates.
PG  - 111-20
AB  - Hagfish represent an ancient lineage of boneless and jawless vertebrates. Among 
      several curious behaviors they exhibit, solitary individuals in one dominant genus 
      of hagfish (Eptatretus spp.) regularly rest in a tightly coiled posture. We present 
      the first systematic treatment of this distinctive behavior. Individual northeastern 
      Pacific hagfish (E. stoutii) exhibited significant handedness (preferred orientation 
      of coiling). However, right-coiling and left-coiling individuals were equally common 
      in the population. Individual hagfish likely develop a preference for one direction 
      by repeating the preceding coiling direction. We also revisit classical accounts of 
      chordate natural history and compare the coiling behavior of Eptatretus with other 
      handed or lateralized behaviors in non-vertebrate chordates, lampreys, and derived 
      vertebrates with elongate bodies. Handed behaviors occur in many of these groups, 
      but they likely evolved independently. In contrast to vertebrates, morphological 
      asymmetries may bias lateralized larval behaviors toward one side in 
      cephalochordates and tunicates. As a consequence, no known handed behavior can be 
      inferred to have existed in the common ancestor of vertebrates.

AB  - The distribution of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in the brain and pituitary 
      of the hagfish Eptatretus burgeri, representing the earliest branch of vertebrates, 
      was examined by immunohistochemistry to better understand the neuroendocrine system 
      of hagfish. CRH-immunoreactive (ir) cell bodies were detected in the preoptic 
      nucleus, periventricular preoptic nucleus, infundibular nucleus of the hypothalamus, 
      and in the nucleus "A" of Kusunoki et al. (1982) in the medulla oblongata. In the 
      brain, CRH-ir fibers were detected in almost all areas except for the olfactory bulb 
      and telencephalon. Bundles of CRH-ir fibers were detected in the dorsal wall of the 
      neurohypophysis. However, CRH-ir fibers were distant from adrenocorticotropic 
      hormone (ACTH) cells in the adenohypophysis, as studied by dual-label 
      immunohistochemistry. Cortisol and corticosterone were detected in the plasma by a 
      combination of reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and a 
      time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay. These results suggest that in the hagfish, CRH, 
      ACTH, and corticosteroids exist and that CRH released in the neurohypophysis likely 
      reaches the adenohypophysis via diffusion.

TI  - Open quaternary structure of the hagfish proteinase inhibitor with similar 
      properties to human alpha-2-macroglobulin.
PG  - 136-45
AB  - A homologous protein to human plasma alpha-2-macroglobulin (alpha-2-M) was purified 
      from the blood plasma of hagfish (Eptatretus buergeri) and its structure and 
      function were studied. The hagfish protein inhibited several proteinases and its 
      inhibitory activity was blocked with methylamine as in the case of human alpha-2-M. 
      The molecular weight and sedimentation coefficient of the hagfish inhibitor were 
      390,000 +/- 20,000 and 11.0 S, respectively, as determined by sedimentation studies. 
      The frictional ratio calculated from these parameters was 1.75. The Stokes radius 
      estimated from HPLC gel chromatography was 8.8-8.9 nm, which was similar to that of 
      human alpha-2-M despite the fact that the hagfish inhibitor was only one-half as 
      large as human alpha-2-M in molecular weight. The hagfish inhibitor was expected to 
      be more asymmetric and/or more hydrated than the human inhibitor. The electron 
      micrographs of the negatively stained hagfish inhibitor showed that it had an open, 
      rectangular quaternary structure of 15 +/- 1.5 X 19 +/- 2 nm in which two 
      semiglobular units were located at the two shorter sides with a gap of 8 +/- 1 nm in 
      width. Each semiglobular unit had an approximate width of 5 +/- 0.5 nm. The 
      thickness of the unit was estimated to be 3 to 3.5 nm from the result of fixed-angle 
      shadowing experiments. Although the two semiglobular units must be connected by some 
      structure, very little material could be seen between them. Such an open quaternary 
      structure may explain the high frictional ratio and large Stokes radius of this 
      protein. The structural change of the inhibitor after reaction with proteinases or 
      methylamine could be detected by electron microscopy and gel chromatography.

PG  - 71-81
AB  - The rate and extent of penetration of radiolabelled polyethylene glycols (900 and 
      4000 daltons) from plasma into brain was examined in the Atlantic hagfish (Myxine 
      glutinosa), a primitive vertebrate, and, for comparison, in the rat. Tracer 
      penetration into brain was limited to a similar extent in hagfish and in rats, 
      indicating a basic similarity between the two species in the blood-brain barrier to 
      polar non-electrolytes. The permeability of hagfish brain capillaries to the 
      electron microscopic tracer microperoxidase (2000 Daltons) was also examined. 
      Intravenously injected microperoxidase remained confined to the capillary lumen and 
      was not found in the basal lamina or surrounding brain parenchyma. In contrast to an 
      earlier study, these results indicate that the hagfish has a blood-brain barrier to 
      hydrophilic molecules larger than 900 Daltons. It is concluded that a blood-brain 
      barrier is a general characteristic of all vertebrates.

AB  - Among vertebrates, hagfish are the only known iono- and osmoconformers, and the only 
      species thus far documented to absorb amino acids directly across the skin. In the 
      current study, short-term (6h) manipulations of exposure salinities (75-125% 
      seawater) were conducted to determine whether changes in osmotic demands influenced 
      the uptake and tissue distribution of waterborne amino acids (alanine, glycine and 
      phenylalanine), in the Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii. No changes in 
      erythrocyte or muscle amino acid accumulation rates were noted, but the patterns of 
      plasma amino acid accumulation were suggestive of regulation. Contrary to 
      expectations, glycine transport across the skin in vitro was enhanced in the lowest 
      exposure salinity, but no other salinity-dependent changes were demonstrated. 
      Overall, this study indicates that uptake and distribution of amino acids varies 
      with salinity, but not in a manner that is consistent with a role for the studied 
      amino acids in maintaining osmotic balance in hagfish.

TI  - Structure and Nanomechanics of Dry and Hydrated Intermediate Filament Films and 
      Fibers Produced from Hagfish Slime Fibers.

LID - 10.1021/acsami.8b17166 [doi]
AB  - Intermediate filaments (IFs) are known for their extensibility, flexibility, 
      toughness, and their ability to hydrate. Using keratin-like IFs obtained from slime 
      fibers from the invertebrate Atlantic hagfish ( Myxine glutinosa), films were 
      produced by drop-casting and coagulation on the surface of a MgCl(2) buffer. 
      Drop-casting produced self-supporting, smooth, and dense films rich in β-sheets 
      (61%), whereas coagulation formed thin, porous films with a nanorough surface and a 
      lower β-sheet content (51%). The films hydrated and swelled immediately when 
      immersed in water and did not dissolve. X-ray diffraction showed that the 
      β-crystallites remained stable upon hydration, that swelling presumably happens in 
      the amorphous C-terminal tail-domains of the IFs, and that high salt conditions 
      caused a denser network mesh size, suggesting polyelectrolyte behavior. Hydration 
      resulted in a roughly 1000-fold decrease in apparent Young's modulus from 10(9) to 
      10(6) Pa as revealed by atomic force microscopy nanoindentation. 
      Nanoindentation-based power-law rheology and stress-relaxation measurements 
      indicated viscoelasticity and a soft-solid hydrogel character for hydrated films, 
      where roughly 80% of energy is elastically stored and 20% is dissipated. By pulling 
      coagulation films from the buffer interface, macroscopic fibers with highly aligned 
      IF β-crystals similar to natural hagfish fibers were produced. We propose that 
      viscoelasticity and strong hydrogen bonding interactions with the buffer interface 
      are crucial for the production of such long biomimetic fibers with aligned β-sheets. 
      This study demonstrates that hagfish fiber IFs can be reconstituted into functional 
      biomimetic materials that are stiff when dry and retain the ability to hydrate to 
      become soft and viscoelastic when in water.

AB  - Although hagfishes are ecologically important members of benthic communities there 
      has been little data available on their metabolism. The oxygen consumption, enzyme 
      activities, and muscle proximate composition of shallow living Eptatretus stoutii 
      and deeper living E. deani were measured to investigate hagfish metabolism. Very low 
      rates of oxygen consumption and both aerobic and anaerobic enzyme activities in the 
      body musculature confirmed the low metabolism of hagfishes. However, significant 
      variation in oxygen consumption existed. E. stoutii had significantly lower rates 
      compared to those of the deeper living E. deani and two other shallow living species 
      for which literature data was used. Both species could regulate their oxygen 
      consumption to very low oxygen concentrations. Epatretus deani, which lives in an 
      oxygen minimum zone, had a significantly lower critical oxygen tension (0.83 kPa) 
      compared to E. stoutii (1.47 kPa). The deeper E. deani had greater lipid stores than 
      E. stoutii which may reflect its deeper habitat and more sporadic food supply.

TI  - Alternative adaptive immunity in jawless vertebrates.
PG  - 1367-74
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.0903128 [doi]
AB  - Jawless vertebrates use variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) that are generated by 
      RAG-independent combinatorial assembly of leucine-rich repeat cassettes for Ag 
      recognition, instead of the Ig-based Ag receptors used by jawed vertebrates. The VLR 
      genes encode for crescent-shaped proteins that use variable beta-strands and a 
      C-terminal loop to bind to Ags rather than the six CDR loops used by BCRs and TCRs. 
      VLR mAbs have been isolated recently, which enabled the structure of VLR-Ag 
      complexes to be defined. The jawless vertebrate adaptive immune system has many 
      similarities to the Ig-based system of jawed vertebrates, including the 
      compartmentalized development of B-like and T-like lymphocyte lineages that 
      proliferate and differentiate into VLR-secreting plasmacytes and proinflammatory 
      cytokine-producing cells in response to Ags. The definition of common features of 
      the VLR-based and Ig-based systems offers fresh insight into the evolution of 
      adaptive immunity.

TI  - Histochemical analyses of hepatic architecture of the hagfish with special attention 
      to periportal biliary structures.
PG  - 450-7
LID - 10.2108/zsj.29.450 [doi]
AB  - The hagfish liver was histochemically examined with special attention to biliary 
      structures around the portal veins. Hepatocytes were organized into tubular 
      structures surrounded by sinusoids. Biliary ductule structures, which resemble the 
      ductal plates transiently appearing in mammalian liver development, were observed 
      around the portal veins, but they did not appear around central veins. Thus, the 
      hagfish liver demonstrates the same basic structure as the mammalian liver; that is, 
      a vascular system from portal to central veins via sinusoids, and portal triad 
      structures consisting of portal veins, hepatic arteries, and intrahepatic bile 
      ducts. The epithelial cells of the ductal platelike structures strongly expressed 
      cytokeratin, had some lectin-binding sites, and were delineated by the basal lamina, 
      which was reactive for periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining and Iectin 
      histochemistry. The lumina of the ductal plate-like structures were comparatively 
      small and heterogeneous in diameter around the portal veins, suggesting that the 
      biliary structures may not be efficient for bile secretion. The epithelial cells of 
      the gall bladder had a simple columnar shape and were a PAS-positive cytoplasm. 
      Those of bile ducts near the hilus, including extrahepatic and hepatic ducts, were 
      simple columnar or cuboidal cells, and had large lumina. The cytoplasm in these 
      cells was PAS-positive. These phenotypes with the expression of lectin-binding sites 
      were clearly different from those of the ductal plate-like structures in the liver 
      proper, suggesting that the extrahepatic and intrahepatic biliary structures may 
      have different developmental origins.

AB  - In most animals, the acquisition of the essential trace metal iron (Fe) is achieved 
      by the gut, but in hagfishes, the skin is a nutrient absorbing epithelium, and thus 
      may also play a role in Fe uptake. In the current study, the absorption of Fe, as 
      Fe(II), across the intestinal and cutaneous epithelia of Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus 
      cirrhatus) was investigated. Both epithelia absorbed Fe, with saturation at lower 
      tested concentrations, superseded by a diffusive component at higher Fe exposure 
      concentrations. Affinity constants (Km) of 9.4 and 137μM, and maximal Fe transport 
      rates (Jmax) of 0.81 and 0.57nmolcm(-2)h(-1) were determined for the skin and the 
      gut, respectively. This characterises the skin as a relatively high-affinity Fe 
      transport epithelium. The majority of the absorbed Fe in the skin remained in the 
      tissue, whereas in the gut, most absorbed Fe was found in the serosal fluid, 
      suggesting distinct mechanisms of Fe handling between the two epithelia. To 
      determine if reduced dissolved oxygen altered Fe transport, hagfish were subjected 
      to hypoxia for 24h, before Fe transport was again assessed. Hypoxia had no effect on 
      Fe transport across gut or skin, likely owing to the relative lack of change in 
      haematological variables, and thus an unaltered Fe demand under such conditions. 
      These data are the first to kinetically characterise the absorption of a nutritive 
      trace metal across the epithelia of hagfish and add to the growing understanding of 
      the role of the skin in nutritive transport in this group.

TI  - Ammonia and urea excretion in the Pacific hagfish Eptatretus stoutii: Evidence for 
      the involvement of Rh and UT proteins.
PG  - 405-15
LID - 10.1016/j.cbpa.2010.08.020 [doi]
AB  - The nature of ammonia and urea excretion was examined in the Pacific hagfish 
      (Eptatretus stoutii), which, under resting conditions, excreted similar quantities 
      of nitrogen as either ammonia or urea. In the presence of high external ammonia 
      (HEA) concentrations, ammonia was taken up at high rates and then excreted at 
      similarly high rates upon return to normal water. However, although elevated by HEA, 
      plasma ammonia levels were maintained at approximately 1-4 μmolNg⁻¹, reflecting 
      time-dependent decreases in the rates of ammonia uptake, the possible conversion of 
      ammonia to urea, and the potential active excretion of ammonia against a gradient. 
      Internal injections of NH₄Cl caused marked increases in the rate of ammonia 
      excretion and a delayed increase in urea excretion that may have resulted from 
      increasing urea levels in the plasma. Conversely, when the rate of urea excretion 
      was reduced in the presence of 0.1 mM phloretin, ammonia excretion was significantly 
      elevated. Rates of urea excretion were initially increased by approximately 
      1000-fold following internal urea injections while the presence of high external 
      urea levels (5-100 mM final concentration) resulted in associated linear increases 
      in plasma urea levels. Using hagfish skin mounted in Ussing chambers, the rate of 
      diffusion of ammonia across the skin exceeded that of urea by approximately four 
      times when equivalent gradients were imposed. Based on western blotting and 
      immunocytochemistry, hagfish gill appears to possess Rh proteins (Rhag, Rhbg and 
      Rhcg1) and urea transporter proteins. Despite the tolerance of hagfish to high 
      levels of ammonia and urea, it is suggested that the presence of ammonia and urea 
      transporter proteins may be required during the period of time hagfish spend in 
      burrows or while feeding, when conditions of high ammonia and/or urea might be 
      encountered.

TI  - Defensive slime formation in Pacific hagfish requires Ca2+- and aquaporin-mediated 
      swelling of released mucin vesicles.
PG  - 2288-96
LID - 10.1242/jeb.101584 [doi]
AB  - Hagfishes defend themselves from fish predators via the rapid deployment of a 
      fibrous slime that adheres to and clogs gills. The slime transforms from a thick 
      glandular exudate to a fully hydrated product in a fraction of a second through a 
      process that involves the swelling and rupture of numerous mucin vesicles. Here we 
      demonstrate that the vesicle membrane plays an important role in regulating the 
      swelling of mucin granules, and provide evidence that the membrane contains proteins 
      that facilitate the movement of ions and water molecules. By exposing isolated mucin 
      vesicles to varying combinations of inorganic ions, organic compounds and membrane 
      channel inhibitors, we found that the majority of hagfish mucin vesicles require 
      Ca(2+) to rupture. We also show that Ca(2+)-dependent rupture can be 
      pharmacologically inhibited, which suggests a role for Ca(2+)-activated membrane 
      transporters. We demonstrate that the aquaporin inhibitor mercuric chloride reduces 
      the rate of vesicle swelling by an order of magnitude, which suggests that 
      aquaporins facilitate the influx of water during vesicle deployment. Molecular 
      evidence of two aquaporin homologues expressed in the slime glands further supports 
      this idea. We propose a model of hagfish slime mucin vesicle rupture that involves 
      Ca(2+)-activated transporters and aquaporins, and suggest that the presence of these 
      proteins is an adaptation for increasing the speed of vesicle rupture and, 
      consequently, the speed of the sliming response of hagfishes.

AB  - In order for an animal to survive, the heart beat must go on in all environmental 
      conditions, or at least restart its beat. This review is about maintaining a 
      rhythmic heartbeat under the extreme conditions of anoxia (or very severe hypoxia) 
      and high temperatures. It starts by considering the primitive versions of the 
      protein channels that are responsible for initiating the heartbeat, HCN channels, 
      divulging recent findings from the ancestral craniate, the Pacific hagfish 
      (Eptatretus stoutii). It then explores how a heartbeat can maintain a rhythm, albeit 
      slower, for hours without any oxygen, and sometimes without autonomic innervation. 
      It closes with a discussion of recent work on fishes, where the cardiac rhythm can 
      become arrhythmic when a fish experiences extreme heat.

AB  - Since a peptide with a C-terminal Arg-Phe-NH2 (RFamide peptide) was first identified 
      in the ganglia of the venus clam in 1977, RFamide peptides have been found in the 
      nervous system of both invertebrates and vertebrates. In vertebrates, the RFamide 
      peptide family includes gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH), neuropeptide FF 
      (NPFF), prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP), pyroglutamylated RFamide 
      peptide/26RFamide peptide (QRFP/26RFa), and kisspeptins (kiss1 and kiss2). They are 
      involved in important functions such as the release of hormones, regulation of 
      sexual or social behavior, pain transmission, reproduction, and feeding. In contrast 
      to tetrapods and jawed fish, the information available on RFamide peptides in 
      agnathans and basal chordates is limited, thus preventing further insights into the 
      evolution of RFamide peptides in vertebrates. In this review, we focus on the 
      previous research and recent advances in the studies on RFamide peptides in 
      agnathans and basal chordates. In agnathans, the genes encoding GnIH, NPFF, and PrRP 
      precursors and the mature peptides have been identified in lamprey (Petromyzon 
      marinus) and hagfish (Paramyxine atami). Putative kiss1 and kiss2 genes have also 
      been found in the genome database of lamprey. In basal chordates, namely, in 
      amphioxus (Branchiostoma japonicum), a common ancestral form of GnIH and NPFF genes 
      and their mature peptides, as well as the ortholog of the QRFP gene have been 
      identified. The studies revealed that the number of orthologs of vertebrate RFamide 
      peptides present in agnathans and basal chordates is greater than expected, 
      suggesting that the vertebrate RFamide peptides might have emerged and expanded at 
      an early stage of chordate evolution.

      hagfish, Myxine glutinosa.
PG  - 352-60
AB  - Changes in gonadal morphology, gonadal estradiol, and progesterone were examined in 
      Atlantic hagfish, Myxine glutinosa, during a period of 17 months, beginning in 
      April, 2001. Atlantic hagfish were captured from the ocean on a monthly basis. A 
      total of 60 hagfish were divided into three different size classes of twenty hagfish 
      each (small 20-35 cm, medium 35-45 cm, large 45-55+cm) and transported to the 
      University of New Hampshire for sampling. Overall, in the medium and large size 
      hagfish, estradiol and progesterone had significantly elevated peaks in January, 
      2001. There were significant increases in estradiol concentrations in January, with 
      relatively low fluctuations in levels for the rest of the sampling period. 
      Progesterone concentrations increased significantly in January, 2002, in medium and 
      large hagfish, and remained elevated until June and April, 2002, for the two size 
      classes respectively. The majority of hagfish sampled were females or 
      hermaphrodites; few true males were identified in any of the samples. The number of 
      females with large eggs increased following the estradiol peak in January and 
      hermaphrodites with mature sperm were identified in the July, 2002, sample. These 
      data represent the first evidence for a seasonal reproductive cycle in M. glutinosa 
      and only the second seasonal reproductive cycle identified in any hagfish species.

AB  - In vertebrates, there are four major genes in the RH (Rhesus) gene family, RH, RHAG, 
      RHBG, and RHCG. These genes are thought to have been formed by the two rounds of 
      whole-genome duplication (2R-WGD) in the common ancestor of all vertebrates. In our 
      previous work, where we analyzed details of the gene duplications process of this 
      gene family, three nucleotide sequences belonging to this family were identified in 
      Far Eastern brook lamprey (Lethenteron reissneri), and the phylogenetic positions of 
      the genes were determined. Lampreys, along with hagfishes, are cyclostomata (jawless 
      fishes), which is a sister group of gnathostomata (jawed vertebrates). Although 
      those results suggested that one gene was orthologous to the gnathostome RHCG genes, 
      we did not identify clear orthologues for other genes. In this study, therefore, we 
      identified three novel cDNA sequences that belong to the RH gene family using de 
      novo transcriptome analysis of another cyclostome: the brown hagfish (Eptatretus 
      atami). We also determined the nucleotide sequences for the RHBG and RHCG genes in a 
      red stingray (Dasyatis akajei), which belongs to the cartilaginous fishes. The 
      phylogenetic tree showed that two brown hagfish genes, which were probably 
      duplicated in the cyclostome lineage, formed a cluster with the gnathostome RHAG 
      genes, whereas another brown hagfish gene formed a cluster with the gnathostome RHCG 
      genes. We estimated that the RH genes had a higher evolutionary rate than the RHAG, 
      RHBG, and RHCG genes. Interestingly, in the RHBG genes, only the bird lineage showed 
      a higher rate of nonsynonymous substitutions. It is likely that this higher rate was 
      caused by a state of relaxed functional constraints rather than positive selection 
      nor by pseudogenization.

TI  - Phylogeny and effects of anoxia on hyperpolarization-activated cyclic

      Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii).
PG  - 4462-72
LID - 10.1242/jeb.094912 [doi]
AB  - The aneural heart of the Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii, varies heart rate 
      fourfold during recovery from anoxia. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic 
      nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, which play an important role in establishing the 
      pacemaker rate of vertebrate hearts, were postulated to be present in this ancestral 
      vertebrate heart, and it was also theorized that changes in hagfish heart rate with 
      oxygen availability involved altered HCN expression. Partial gene cloning revealed 
      six HCN isoforms in the hagfish heart. Hagfish representatives of HCN2, HCN3 and 
      HCN4 were discovered, with HCN2 and HCN3 existing as isoforms designated as HCN2a, 
      HCN2b, HCN3a, two paralogs of HCN3b, and HCN3c. Phylogenetic analysis revealed HCN3b 
      and HCN3c to be ancestral, followed by HCN3a, HCN4 and HCN2. Moreover, HCN3a 
      expression was dominant in both the atrial and ventricular chambers, suggesting that 
      the HCN4 dominance in adult mammalian hearts appeared after hagfish divergence. HCN 
      expression was higher in the atrium than in the ventricle, as might be expected 
      given that atrial beating rate is known to be faster than the ventricular rate. In 
      addition, mRNA expression under normoxic conditions was compared with that following 
      24 h of anoxia, and either a 2-h or 36-h recovery in normoxic water. In the 
      ventricle, anoxia decreased HCN3a but not HCN4 expression. In contrast, atrial HCN3a 
      expression significantly increased following 2 h of recovery, before returning to 
      control levels following 36 h of recovery, possibly contributing to heart rate 
      changes previously observed under these conditions.

TI  - Comparison of the biochemical composition of normal epidermal mucus and extruded

PG  - 625-32

AB  - Hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) secrete normal epidermal mucus and extruded slime. The 
      epidermal mucus is produced continuously to prevent pathogen adherence while the 
      extruded slime is observed predominantly during feeding, provocation or stress. To 
      date little is known about the involvement of extruded slime in the physiological 
      functions of hagfish. In this preliminary study, innate immune enzymes and the 
      protein composition of hagfish normal epidermal mucus and extruded slime were 
      analysed and compared. The lysozyme specific activity of hagfish was observed 
      approximately two-fold higher in extruded slime than that of epidermal mucus. The 
      extruded slime had approximately 3.5-5.0 fold increased levels of alkaline 
      phosphatase, cathepsin B and proteases in comparison to epidermal mucus. Protease 
      characterization using specific inhibitors showed that the extruded slime had higher 
      levels of serine trypsin-like proteases compared to metalloproteases whereas 
      epidermal mucus showed equal proportion of both serine and metalloproteases. 
      SDS-PAGE analysis showed high levels of three proteins with molecular masses in the 
      range of 13-16kDa in the extruded slime. The LC/MS/MS analysis of protein bands 1, 2 
      and 3 showed closest matches to hemoglobulin-3, histone H3 and H2B proteins, 
      respectively. The observation of elevated levels of innate immune parameters in the 
      extruded slime suggested that the extruded slime has a significant role in innate 
      immunity of hagfish against infectious pathogens.

AB  - Pharmacological ion-channel blockers were used to investigate the spontaneous heart 
      rates in Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii. Zatebradine, a 
      hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel blocker, vastly 
      reduced atrial and ventricular contraction rates in a similar 
      concentration-dependent manner, indicating a major role for HCN in setting intrinsic 
      heart rate. When voltage-gated Na(+) channels were blocked with tetrodotoxin (TTX), 
      atrial contraction rate declined in a dose-dependent manner, but remained faster 
      than ventricular rate even at very high TTX concentrations. This TTX resistance 
      compared with other fish suggests an important role for a TTX-sensitive 
      inactivation-resistant Na(+) current in atrioventricular conduction and chamber 
      synchrony, and a lesser role in setting intrinsic heart rate. T and L-type calcium 
      channel blockers, nickel and nifedipine respectively, also reduced atrial and 
      ventricular contraction rates, nickel having a larger effect on the atrium. These 
      novel results for hagfish are consistent with intrinsic atrial and ventricular rates 
      being set mostly by HCN, with lesser contributions from other ion channels. We 
      suggest that future electrophysiological studies will reveal that hagfishes, with 
      their ancestral position in the evolution of the vertebrate-type chambered heart, 
      share some but not all features of vertebrate intrinsic heart rate control.

TI  - Structural basis of the aberrant receptor binding properties of hagfish and lamprey 
      insulins.
PG  - 11283-95
LID - 10.1021/bi901269j [doi]
AB  - The insulin from the Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) has been one of the most 
      studied insulins from both a structural and a biological viewpoint; however, some 
      aspects of its biology remain controversial, and there has been no satisfying 
      structural explanation for its low biological potency. We have re-examined the 
      receptor binding kinetics, as well as the metabolic and mitogenic properties, of 
      this phylogenetically ancient insulin, as well as that from another extant 
      representative of the ancient chordates, the river lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis). 
      Both insulins share unusual binding kinetics and biological properties with insulin 
      analogues that have single mutations at residues that contribute to the 
      hexamerization surface. We propose and demonstrate by reciprocal amino acid 
      substitutions between hagfish and human insulins that the reduced biological 
      activity of hagfish insulin results from unfavorable substitutions, namely, A10 (Ile 
      to Arg), B4 (Glu to Gly), B13 (Glu to Asn), and B21 (Glu to Val). We likewise 
      suggest that the altered biological activity of lamprey insulin may reflect 
      substitutions at A10 (Ile to Lys), B4 (Glu to Thr), and B17 (Leu to Val). The 
      substitution of Asp at residue B10 in hagfish insulin and of His at residue A8 in 
      both hagfish and lamprey insulins may help compensate for unfavorable changes in 
      other regions of the molecules. The data support the concept that the set of unusual 
      properties of insulins bearing certain mutations in the hexamerization surface may 
      reflect those of the insulins evolutionarily closer to the ancestral insulin gene 
      product.

TI  - Evolution of the insulin gene superfamily. Sequence of a preproinsulin-like growth 
      factor cDNA from the Atlantic hagfish.
PG  - 2397-402
AB  - Complementary DNAs encoding a preproinsulin-like growth factor (prepro-IGF) have 
      been cloned from a primitive vertebrate species, the Atlantic hagfish, by using a 
      DNA amplification strategy based on the polymerase chain reaction. A composite 
      sequence containing a 414-nucleotide open reading frame encoding 138 amino acids and 
      164 nucleotides in the 3'-untranslated region was obtained. The deduced partial 
      sequence of hagfish prepro-IGF reveals that it is organized like the mammalian 
      prepro-IGFs with an unusually large (greater than 39-amino acid) signal peptide 
      (initiator methionine residue is missing), 29-amino acid B, 15-amino acid C, 
      21-amino acid A, 10-amino acid D, and 26-amino acid E domains. All the invariant 
      residues necessary to form the correct tertiary fold of an insulin-like molecule 
      have been conserved in hagfish IGF. Sequence comparisons revealed that the A and B 
      domains of hagfish IGF are equally similar to those of human IGF-I (35 out of 50 
      amino acids) or IGF-II (37 out of 53 amino acids). In contrast, the similarity 
      between hagfish and mammalian pro-IGFs in the C, D, and E domains is relatively low. 
      Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from hagfish brain, heart, liver, skeletal 
      muscle, and islet organ, however, indicated that hagfish IGF, like mammalian IGF-I, 
      is expressed predominantly in the liver as a 4.2-kilobase transcript. DNA blot 
      analysis revealed that hagfish IGF is a single copy gene. The predicted sequence of 
      hagfish prepro-IGF thus demonstrates that the divergence of the IGF and insulin 
      genes occurred prior to the separation of the Agnatha and that the organization and 
      tertiary structure of IGF have been well maintained throughout 550 million years of 
      vertebrate evolution.

TI  - Neurohormonal peptides in the gut of the Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) 
      detected using antisera raised against mammalian regulatory peptides.
PG  - 292-300
AB  - Concentrations of regulatory peptides in an extract of the intestine of the 
      cyclostome, Myxine glutinosa (Atlantic hagfish), were measured by radioimmunoassay 
      using 12 antisera of defined regional specificity that were raised against mammalian 
      gastrointestinal peptides. The hagfish gut contained somatostatin-, 
      cholecystokinin/gastrin-, C-terminal substance P-, and neurokinin A-like 
      immunoreactivity in concentrations that were 10 to 100 times less than the 
      corresponding concentrations in the rat intestine. The hagfish gut also contained 
      glucagon-like immunoreactivity, measured with both C- and N-terminally directed 
      antisera, but the immunoreactivity did not dilute in parallel with the porcine 
      glucagon standard in radio-immunoassay. No immunoreactivity was detected using 
      antisera to calcitonin gene-related peptide, gastrin-releasing peptide, neuromedin 
      U, neurotensin, N-terminal substance P, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. The 
      somatostatin-like immunoreactivity in the hagfish gut was resolved by HPLC into 
      components with the retention times of somatostatin-34 and somatostatin-14, 
      previously isolated from the hagfish islet organ (relative abundance 2:1). The 
      retention times of hagfish glucagon and of the multiple molecular forms of the 
      tachykinin-like peptides were appreciably different from the retention times of the 
      corresponding mammalian peptides.

TI  - An alternative model for the structural mechanics of hagfish slime threads.
PG  - 420-8
LID - 10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2008.02.001 [doi]
AB  - Hagfish slime threads are an interesting intermediate filament (IF) system in that, 
      in contrast to hair, they appear to be a series system of IFs, consisting of rods 
      and terminal domains (TDs), without matrix. The protein composition also differs 
      from hair. Published data show that the wet stress-strain curve consists of four 
      regions: I, increasing low modulus; II, plateau; III increasing higher modulus; IV 
      decreasing modulus to break. Beyond 34% extension, there is plastic deformation, 
      which contrasts with the elastic deformation of most biological fibres. The paper 
      considers two explanations, one published by Fudge et al. [D.S. Fudge, K.H. Gardner, 
      V.T. Forsyth, C. Riekel, J.M. Gosline, Biophys. J. 85 (2003) 2015] and one new, of 
      deformation in the four regions. The former regards the TDs as elastic, entropic 
      coils, which extend in region I. The latter regards the TDs as having a plastic, 
      energy-dependent extension in regions III and IV, which is comparable to the drawing 
      of polyester fibres. A rough theoretical model of jumps over energy barriers gives a 
      similar prediction. Twist is suggested as a mechanism for overall thread cohesion. 
      Experimental and theoretical ways forward to a greater understanding of the 
      structural mechanics of hagfish threads are suggested. The behaviour of the total 
      thread/mucus/water system is discussed and some speculations on the defensive 
      mechanisms that have evolved are presented.

AB  - A new species of seven-gilled hagfish Eptatretus astrolabium (Myxinidae) is 
      described from a 400 mm total length female trapped 1 km east from Planet Rock, 
      Astrolabe Bay, Papua New Guinea, at c. 500 m depth. This is the first hagfish 
      species reported from the waters around New Guinea. It can be distinguished from 
      other hagfishes by a combination of characters including seven pairs of gill 
      apertures, three-cusp multicusps on the anterior and posterior rows of cusps, 10 
      posterior unicusps, 52 total cusps, 18-19 prebranchial pores, five branchial pores, 
      48-49 trunk pores, 83-84 total pores and no nasal-sinus papillae.

TI  - Deployment of hagfish slime thread skeins requires the transmission of mixing forces 
      via mucin strands.
PG  - 1235-40
LID - 10.1242/jeb.038075 [doi]
AB  - Hagfishes are benthic marine protovertebrates that secrete copious quantities of 
      slime when threatened. The slime originates as a two-component glandular exudate 
      comprised of coiled bundles of cytoskeletal intermediate filaments (thread skeins) 
      and mucin vesicles. Holocrine secretion of the slime into seawater results in the 
      rapid deployment of both fibrous and mucin components, resulting in about a liter of 
      dilute slime. Deployment of the thread skeins involves their unraveling in a 
      fraction of a second from a 150 microm-long ellipsoid bundle to a thread that is 
      100x longer. We hypothesized that thread skein deployment requires both vigorous 
      hydrodynamic mixing and the presence of mucin vesicles, both of which are required 
      for whole slime deployment. Here we provide evidence that mixing and mucin vesicles 
      are indeed crucial for skein unraveling. Specifically, we show that mucin vesicles 
      mixed into seawater swell and elongate into high-aspect ratio mucin strands that 
      attach to the thread skeins, transmit hydrodynamic forces to them and effect their 
      unraveling by loading them in tension. Our discovery of mucin strands in hagfish 
      slime not only provides a mechanism for the rapid deployment of thread skeins in 
      vivo, it also helps explain how hagfish slime is able to trap such impressive 
      volumes of seawater via viscous entrainment. We believe that the deployment of 
      thread skeins via their interaction with shear-elongated mucins represents a unique 
      mechanism in biology and may lead to novel technologies for transmitting 
      hydrodynamic forces to microscale particles that would typically be immune to such 
      forces.

TI  - Gonadotropin releasing hormone in the primitive vertebrate family Myxinidae: 
      reproductive neuroanatomy and evolutionary aspects.
PG  - 177-83
AB  - The family Myxinidae embraces all hagfish species, and occupies an evolutionary 
      niche intermediate between ancestral vertebrates and the gnathostomes (jawed 
      vertebrates). Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) modulates neuroendocrine 
      activity in vertebrates and works in the context of the hypothalamic-pituitary (H-P) 
      axis. The appearance of this neuroendocrine axis marks one of the most crucial 
      developmental achievements in vertebrate evolution, because it enabled further 
      diversification in general growth, metabolism, osmoregulation and reproduction as 
      jawed vertebrates evolved. GnRH studies in hagfish draw attention because such work 
      may be considered as providing proxy data for similar investigations conducted upon 
      long extinct species. Indeed, the fossil record reveals little anatomical difference 
      between those hagfish living 300 million years ago and their modern descendants. 
      Accordingly, the hagfish can offer important evolutionary lessons as they have some 
      highly unusual characteristics not seen in any other vertebrate; they retain many 
      representative features of an ancestral state from which all vertebrates originated. 
      Indeed, because central control of reproduction is perhaps the most basic function 
      of the vertebrate H-P axis, and given the importance of GnRH in this network, 
      research on GnRH in hagfish can help elucidate the early evolution of the H-P system 
      itself. Like all vertebrates, hagfish have a functional hypothalamic area and a 
      pituitary gland, constituting a basic H-P axis. But what role does GnRH play in the 
      reproductive system of this "living fossil"? How can understanding GnRH in hagfish 
      help advance the knowledge of vertebrate neuroendocrinology? Here, information on 
      neuroendocrine function and the role of GnRH specifically in this very basal 
      vertebrate is reviewed.

TI  - Vascular bed-specific endothelium-dependent vasomomotor relaxation in the hagfish, 
      Myxine glutinosa.
PG  - R894-900
AB  - The last common ancestor of hagfish and gnathostomes was also the last common 
      ancestor of all extant vertebrates that lived some time more than 500 million years 
      ago. Features that are shared between hagfish and gnathostomes can be inferred to 
      have already been present in this ancestral vertebrate. We recently reported that 
      hagfish endothelium displays phenotypic heterogeneity in ultrastructure, lectin 
      binding, and mechanisms of leukocyte adhesion. Thus, phenotypic cell heterogeneity 
      evolved as an early feature of the endothelium. In the present study, we wanted to 
      extend these observations by determining whether hagfish endothelium plays a role in 
      mediating vasomotor tone. Response of mesenteric and skeletal muscle arteries to a 
      variety of mediators was assayed by videomicroscopy. Phenylephrine and acetylcholine 
      induced vasoconstriction of mesenteric and skeletal muscle arteries. Bradykinin (BK) 
      and ADP promoted vasorelaxation in precontracted mesenteric arteries but not those 
      from skeletal muscle. BK- and ADP-mediated vasorelaxation of the mesenteric artery 
      was abrogated by mechanical denudation of the endothelium but was unaffected by 
      N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. Indomethacin significantly inhibited the 
      vasodilatory response to ADP but not BK. The nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside 
      resulted in endothelium-independent relaxation of both mesenteric and skeletal 
      muscle arteries. Together, these data suggest that site-specific 
      endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation is an evolutionarily conserved property of this 
      cell lineage.

TI  - Eptatretus strickrotti n. sp. (Myxinidae): first hagfish captured from a 
      hydrothermal vent.
PG  - 55-66
AB  - A single hagfish (Myxinidae, Eptatretus) specimen was recently captured at a 
      hydrothermal vent site on the East Pacific Rise (38 degrees S). This is the first 
      capture of a member of the jawless fishes (agnathans) from a hydrothermal vent site. 
      The specimen differs from all congeners by the very slender body (depth 2.9% of 
      total length), the paired and median ventral nasal sinus papillae, and the presence 
      of 10 afferent branchial arteries on the medial ventral aorta. It is further unique 
      because of a combination of the following features: slime pore counts; paired dorsal 
      nasal sinus papillae; 12 gill pouches and gill apertures; posterior left side of 
      body widely separated from pharyngocutaneous duct; 3/2 multicusp configuration; 
      ventral aorta bifurcated anteriorly between 2nd and 3rd gill pouches (counted from 
      the snout toward the heart); and pink coloration. The specimen is here described as 
      a new species named Eptatretus strickrotti. Molecular 16S rRNA data places this new 
      species as the basal-most species of Eptatretus, providing important new insight to 
      the evolution of hagfishes as a whole.

TI  - Novel route of toxicant exposure in an ancient extant vertebrate: nickel uptake by 
      hagfish skin and the modifying effects of slime.
PG  - 1896-902
LID - 10.1021/es5052815 [doi]
AB  - Utilizing an in vitro technique, the skin of Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stouti) was 
      shown to take up nickel from the water via a high affinity, low capacity transport 
      pathway. Uptake was biphasic, with saturation occurring at low nickel exposure 
      concentrations, superseded by linear, diffusive uptake at levels greater than 50 μM. 
      In vivo exposures showed that nickel accumulated mainly in the gill, heart, and 
      brain, representing a tissue distribution distinct from that found in teleosts. 
      Slime on the epidermal surface was shown to significantly reduce the uptake of low 
      concentrations (10 μM) of the metals zinc and nickel, but slime had no effect on 
      organic nutrient (the amino acid l-alanine) absorption. At a higher metal exposure 
      concentration (1 mM), slime was no longer protective, indicating saturation of 
      metal-binding sites. This is the first study to show that metals can be taken up by 
      the integument of hagfish. The ability of the skin to act as a transport epithelium 
      may be of particular importance for a burrowing, benthic scavenger, such as hagfish, 
      which are likely to be exposed to relatively enriched levels of metal toxicants 
      through their habitat and lifestyle, and this may have consequences for human health 
      through hagfish consumption.

TI  - Sex differentiation in the hagfish Eptatretus stouti.
PG  - 309-23
AB  - A detailed study was made of sex differentiation in three anteroposteriorly 
      distributed body regions of the long gonadal fold in young Pacific hagfish 
      (Eptatretus stouti) from 12.4 to 45 cm in length. In general, the posterior region, 
      adjacent to the cloaca, remained undifferentiated, and only in specimens more than 
      28 cm long was there development of this region into a differentiated testis. On the 
      other hand, the anterior gonadal region of all specimens under 20 cm developed 
      continually and progressively through stages that included cystic nests of cells 
      derived from the germinal epithelium, acquisition of follicular investments around 
      these cells, growth of these young oocytes and break-up of their original follicular 
      groupings, and, finally, in larger specimens, vitellogenesis. Although the earliest 
      oocytes formed in cyst-like nests of cells, later oocytes were derived individually 
      directly from the germinal epithelium. In larger specimens, in which testicular 
      development occurred in the posterior part of the gonad, the anterior gonad 
      involuted, leaving a thin structure that lacks germ cells. There were numerous 
      exceptions to this general description of events, indicating a certain degree of 
      lability of determination of a particular gonadal region to either male or female 
      differentiation. Some earlier stages of female differentiation could occur in the 
      posterior gonadal region of a few smaller animals. Some posteriorly located 
      ovotestes (differentiated elements of both sexes) developed in a few specimens 
      between 16 and 21 cm in length, but were not seen in larger animals. Some testicular 
      follicles appeared in the anterior gonadal regions of three specimens between 20 and 
      25 cm in length, but not in specimens larger than that. Three hermaphroditic 
      specimens between 29 and 33 cm in length were found in which there was a 
      well-differentiated testis posteriorly and a well-differentiated ovary (vitellogenic 
      eggs) anteriorly. Questions of hermaphroditism, lability of sex determination, and 
      possible epigenetic influences on these phenomena are taken up in the discussion. 
      Since this study provides the first correlation of stages of sex differentiation 
      with animal length, it forms the basis for experimental approaches in E. stouti to 
      analysis of mechanisms of sex determination and differentiation.

TI  - A NMR-based metabolomic approach for differentiation of hagfish dental and somatic 
      skeletal muscles.
PG  - 701-7
LID - 10.1007/s10695-011-9470-7 [doi]
AB  - The hagfish dental muscle is a large and specialized element of the feeding 
      apparatus that helps ingest food. This muscle has enzymatic activities and 
      contractile properties different from the hagfish somatic skeletal muscle. To verify 
      the functional relevance of protein alterations, we examined the metabolomic 
      differentiation of hagfish dental and somatic skeletal muscles using ¹H-nuclear 
      magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics and multivariate analysis that separated 
      hagfish dental and somatic muscles by principal component analysis and partial least 
      squares for discriminant analysis. Our analysis of assigned metabolites showed that 
      anserine and taurine levels were higher in dental muscle, but creatine, fructose, 
      glucose, glycerate, pyruvate, and succinate levels were higher in somatic muscle. We 
      concluded that the primary energy sources of dental and somatic muscles are related 
      to the citric acid cycle and the anaerobic glycolysis and metabolism of creatine. 
      Thus, ¹H-NMR-based metabolomics can be integrated with the previous proteomic 
      approach to derive biochemical and physiological information about hagfish muscles.

AB  - Pharyngeal gills are a fundamental feature of the vertebrate body plan [1]. However, 
      the evolutionary history of vertebrate gills has been the subject of a long-standing 
      controversy [2-8]. It is thought that gills evolved independently in cyclostomes 
      (jawless vertebrates-lampreys and hagfish) and gnathostomes (jawed 
      vertebrates-cartilaginous and bony fishes), based on their distinct embryonic 
      origins: the gills of cyclostomes derive from endoderm [9-12], while gnathostome 
      gills were classically thought to derive from ectoderm [10, 13]. Here, we 
      demonstrate by cell lineage tracing that the gills of a cartilaginous fish, the 
      little skate (Leucoraja erinacea), are in fact endodermally derived. This finding 
      supports the homology of gills in cyclostomes and gnathostomes, and a single origin 
      of pharyngeal gills prior to the divergence of these two ancient vertebrate 
      lineages.

TI  - The preparation of poly(A)+mRNA from the hagfish slime gland.
PG  - 67-76
AB  - The isolation of translatable poly(A)+mRNA from the slime glands of the Pacific 
      hagfish, Eptatretus stouti, is not possible by the commonly used procedures because 
      of the viscous slime that is formed when the contents of the glands are hydrated. 
      This paper reports on a procedure developed to overcome this problem. Briefly, the 
      tissue was powdered in liquid nitrogen, mixed with sodium lauroylsarcosine and 
      proteinase K and lyophilized. The lyophilized powder was then mixed with 0.3 mm 
      diameter glass beads, thoroughly ground and wetted with buffer and digested at 37 
      degrees C. The RNA from the digest was recovered by ultracentrifugation through a 
      CsCl cushion. Further purification of the RNA was accomplished by the usual methods 
      with slight modifications.

PG  - 137-41
LID - 10.1007/s10126-010-9299-6 [doi]
AB  - The effects of high hydrostatic pressure on lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities 
      from two species of hagfish were examined. LDH from Eptatretus okinoseanus, a 
      deep-sea species, retained 67% of the original activity even at 100 MPa. LDH 
      activity from Eptatretus burgeri, a shallow-sea species, was completely lost at 
      50 MPa but recovered to the original value at 0.1 MPa. The tetrameric structure of 
      LDH-A(4) from E. okinoseanus did not change at 50 MPa. In contrast, almost all LDH 
      tetramers from E. burgeri dissociated to dimers and monomers at 50 MPa but reverted 
      to tetramers at 0.1 MPa. These results show that the dissociation of tetramers 
      caused the inactivation of E. burgeri LDH. The difference depends on the number 6 
      and 10 amino acids. The mechanism of the slight, gradual inactivation of E. 
      okinoseanus LDH at high pressure differs and is probably due to the metamorphosis of 
      its inner structures.

      involvement of gill V-H+-ATPase and Na+/K+-ATPase.
PG  - 133-41
AB  - To investigate the base secretory mechanisms in the Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus 
      stoutii), we injected animals with NaHCO3 into the subcutaneous sinus. In the first 
      series of experiments, hagfish were injected with 6000 micromol kg(-1) NaHCO3 
      (base-infused hagfish, BIH) or NaCl (controls). Blood pH increased significantly 1 h 
      after injection in BIH (8.05+/-0.05 vs. 7.82+/-0.03 pH units), but returned to 
      control values by t=6 h. Plasma total CO2 (TCO2) followed the same pattern. 
      Immunolabeled sections revealed that Na+/K+-ATPase and V-H+-ATPase were usually 
      located in the same cells. Western blotting revealed that the abundance of both 
      proteins remained unchanged in whole gill homogenates and in a fraction enriched in 
      cell membranes 6 h after the injections. The second experimental series was to 
      induce long-term alkalosis by serially injecting 6000 micromol kg(-1) NaHCO3 every 6 
      h for 24 h. Blood pH completely recovered from the base loads within 6 h after each 
      injection. Moreover, plasma TCO2 was not elevated 3 h after the second infusion, 
      suggesting that HCO3(-) secreting mechanisms had been upregulated by that time. 
      Na+/K+-ATPase and V-H+-ATPase cellular localizations did not change in the 24 h base 
      infusion protocol. Na+/K+-ATPase abundance was similar in gill homogenates from fish 
      from both treatments. However, Na+/K+-ATPase abundance in the membrane fraction was 
      significantly lower in BIH, while V-H+-ATPase was greater both in whole gill and 
      membrane fractions. Our results suggest that differential insertion of V-H+-ATPase 
      and Na+/K+-ATPase into the basolateral membrane is involved in recovering from 
      alkalotic stress in hagfish.

AB  - Meeting the challenge of sampling an ancient aquatic landscape by the early 
      vertebrates was crucial to their survival and would establish a retinal bauplan to 
      be used by all subsequent vertebrate descendents. Image-forming eyes were under 
      tremendous selection pressure and the ability to identify suitable prey and detect 
      potential predators was thought to be one of the major drivers of speciation in the 
      Early Cambrian. Based on the fossil record, we know that hagfishes, lampreys, 
      holocephalans, elasmobranchs and lungfishes occupy critical stages in vertebrate 
      evolution, having remained relatively unchanged over hundreds of millions of years. 
      Now using extant representatives of these 'living fossils', we are able to piece 
      together the evolution of vertebrate photoreception. While photoreception in 
      hagfishes appears to be based on light detection and controlling circadian rhythms, 
      rather than image formation, the photoreceptors of lampreys fall into five distinct 
      classes and represent a critical stage in the dichotomy of rods and cones. At least 
      four types of retinal cones sample the visual environment in lampreys mediating 
      photopic (and potentially colour) vision, a sampling strategy retained by 
      lungfishes, some modern teleosts, reptiles and birds. Trichromacy is retained in 
      cartilaginous fishes (at least in batoids and holocephalans), where it is predicted 
      that true scotopic (dim light) vision evolved in the common ancestor of all living 
      gnathostomes. The capacity to discriminate colour and balance the tradeoff between 
      resolution and sensitivity in the early vertebrates was an important driver of eye 
      evolution, where many of the ocular features evolved were retained as vertebrates 
      progressed on to land.

TI  - Characterization of novel RFamide peptides in the central nervous system of the 
      brown hagfish: isolation, localization, and functional analysis.
PG  - 4252-64
LID - 10.1210/en.2011-1375 [doi]
AB  - RFamide (RFa) peptides play various important roles in the central nervous system in 
      both invertebrates and vertebrates. However, there is no evidence of the existence 
      of any RFamide peptide in the brain of hagfish, one of the oldest lineages of 
      vertebrates. In this study, we sought to identify novel RFamide peptides from the 
      brains of hagfish (Paramyxine atami). We identified four novel RFamide peptides, 
      which had the C-terminal Pro-Gln-Arg-Phe-NH2 structure. cDNA cloning revealed that 
      the identified RFamide peptides are encoded in two types of cDNA. Molecular 
      phylogenetic analysis of the two precursors indicated that the hagfish RFamide 
      peptides belong to the PQRFamide peptide group that includes mammalian neuropeptide 
      FF and AF. Based on immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, hagfish 
      PQRFamide peptide precursor mRNA and its translated peptides were localized in the 
      infundibular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Immunoreactive fibers were terminated on 
      blood vessels in the infundibular nucleus. Dense immunoreactive fibers were also 
      observed in other brain regions. We further showed that one of the hagfish PQRFamide 
      peptides significantly stimulated the expression of gonadotropin-β mRNA in the 
      cultured hagfish pituitary. These results indicate that the control mechanism of 
      gonadotropin expression by a hypothalamic neuropeptide evolved in the agnathan 
      brain. This is the first evidence describing the identification of RFamide peptides 
      in the hagfish brain. This is also the first report showing the regulation of 
      gonadotropin expression by a homolog of neuropeptide FF that belongs to the 
      PQRFamide peptide group in any vertebrate.

TI  - Stimulation of calcium efflux from the hagfish, Eptatretus cirrhatus, gill pouch by 
      an extract of corpuscles of Stannius from an eel (Anguilla dieffenbachii): 
      teleostei.
PG  - 92-103
AB  - A factor present in the homogenate of the corpuscles of Stannius from a teleost, the 
      longfin eel Anguilla dieffenbachii, showed calcitropic effects in an agnathan, the 
      hagfish Eptatretus cirrhatus. This factor greatly increased calcium efflux from an 
      isolated perfused gill pouch preparation and had no effect on calcium influx. 
      Hagfish regulated plasma total calcium at a concentration which was about 50% of 
      that of the ambient seawater. Intact hagfish had rates of calcium influx and efflux 
      which were similar to those recorded in teleosts. Hagfish are thus similar to 
      teleosts to the extent that they can and do maintain a plasma calcium concentration 
      which is quite different from that of the ambient medium. They also resemble 
      teleosts in that transepithelial calcium fluxes across the hagfish gill pouches 
      respond to extracts of Stannius corpuscles. Hagfish, however, are quite unlike 
      teleosts in that the Stannius corpuscle extract stimulates calcium efflux rather 
      than inhibiting calcium influx.

TI  - Two variable lymphocyte receptor genes of the inshore hagfish are located far apart 
      on the same chromosome.
PG  - 329-31
AB  - Variable lymphocyte receptors (VLR) generate enormous diversity through assembling 
      highly diverse leucine-rich repeat (LRR) modules and presumably function as antigen 
      receptors in jawless vertebrates. The hagfish, which constitute major extant members 
      of jawless vertebrates along with lampreys, have two VLR genes designated VLRA and 
      VLRB, whereas only a single VLR gene has been identified in the lamprey. In the 
      present study, we show by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) that hagfish 
      VLRA and VLRB are located on the same chromosome, but are far apart from each other. 
      Analysis of available inshore hagfish complementary DNA sequences indicates that 
      VLRA and VLRB do not share a LRR module with an identical nucleotide sequence. 
      Physical separation of VLRA and VLRB is consistent with this observation and 
      indicates that the two VLR genes function as separate units. The FISH protocol 
      developed in this study should be useful for the analysis of the agnathan genome.

TI  - Evolution of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) function: production and 
      characterization of recombinant hagfish IGF.
PG  - 79-90
AB  - While there is considerable structural evidence that insulin-like growth factors 
      (IGFs) share a long evolutionary history, little is known about the conservation of 
      IGF function. In order to address this, we have made recombinant hagfish IGF, hence 
      allowing characterization of an IGF from a representative of the primitive 
      vertebrate class, Agnatha. The production of recombinant hagfish IGF has been 
      complicated by a number of factors including the requirement of a longer leader 
      peptide for fusion protein expression, reduced solubility of the protein, as well as 
      problems in the refolding procedure. However, we were able to produce a small 
      quantity of hagfish IGF with an N-terminal glycine addition which is biologically 
      active. Furthermore, N-terminal amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry confirm 
      that we have produced hagfish IGF. In vitro assessment of recombinant hagfish IGF in 
      cultured cells indicates that hagfish IGF indeed shares functional properties with 
      mammalian IGFs. Thus, hagfish IGF stimulates protein synthesis in rat myoblasts, but 
      20- and 5-fold more peptide, respectively, is required to achieve the same 
      half-maximal responses as with human IGF-I (hIGF-I) or IGF-II (hIGF-II). Hagfish IGF 
      also competes for binding to the type-1 IGF receptor present both on rat myoblasts 
      and on salmon embryo fibroblasts, though with somewhat lower affinity than either 
      hIGF-I or hIGF-II. However, studies investigating binding to the IGF-II-specific 
      type-2 receptor suggest that hagfish IGF may in fact be more closely related to 
      IGF-I than to IGF-II. These results indicate that motifs important for functions 
      associated with mammalian IGFs appear to have evolved prior to the Agnathans 
      diverging from the main line of vertebrate evolution 550 million years ago. 
      Accordingly, we now have functional as well as structural evidence that the IGFs 
      have a long evolutionary history.

AB  - Unlike jawed vertebrates that use T-cell and B-cell receptors for antigen 
      recognition, jawless vertebrates represented by lampreys and hagfish use variable 
      lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) as antigen receptors. VLRs generate diversity comparable 
      to that of gnathostome antigen receptors by assembling variable leucine-rich repeat 
      modules. The discovery of VLR has revolutionized our understanding of how adaptive 
      immunity emerged and highlighted the differences between the adaptive immune systems 
      (AISs) of jawed and jawless vertebrates. However, emerging evidence also indicates 
      that their AISs have much in common. Particularly striking is the conservation of 
      lymphocyte lineages. The basic architecture of the AIS including the dichotomy of 
      lymphocytes appears to have been established in a common ancestor of jawed and 
      jawless vertebrates. We review here the current knowledge on the AIS of jawless

TI  - Biochemical and immunochemical characterization of two discrete vitellogenin 
      proteins and their derived lipovitellins in the inshore hagfish (Eptatretus 
      burgeri).
PG  - 251-7

AB  - Vitellogenesis has been extensively studied in oviparous vertebrates, including 
      teleost fishes, while not much is known with regard to jawless hagfishes, modern 
      representatives of the most primitive vertebrate class. This study aimed to 
      characterize vitellogenin (Vtg) and yolk protein (YP) in the inshore hagfish 
      (Eptatretus burgeri) as an initial step to understand vitellogenesis in this 
      species. A putative Vtg fraction was purified from the serum of female hagfish by 
      combinations of hydroxylapatite and ion-exchange chromatography, followed by gel 
      filtration. The purified fraction appeared to contain two distinct Vtgs (Vtg1 and 
      Vtg2) and exhibited biochemical properties resembling those previously reported for 
      teleost Vtgs; these appeared to be female-specific serum proteins and 
      high-molecular-weight proteins in gel filtration (˜505 kDa as the mixture fraction 
      of both Vtgs) and in SDS-PAGE (Vtg1 and Vtg2; ˜210 kDa and ˜195 kDa, respectively). 
      A major YP was also purified from hagfish eggs by combinations of hydroxylapatite 
      chromatography and gel filtration; the apparent native mass of the purified YP was 
      unusually large (> 669 kDa). The purified YP consisted of four polypeptides in 
      SDS-PAGE; the peptide pattern indicated that it consisted of two lipovitellins (Lv1 
      and Lv2) giving rise to two sets of heavy chains (˜116 kDa and ˜106 kDa, 
      respectively) and two light chains (˜32 kDa and ˜28 kDa, respectively). Additional 
      immunological analysis, Nterminal amino acid sequencing and cDNA cloning firmly 
      confirmed the precursor-product relationship between hagfish Vtgs and Lvs.

TI  - Cardiovascular responses to hypoxia in the hagfish, Eptatretus cirrhatus.
PG  - 373-86
AB  - Simultaneous measurements of cardiac output (Q), blood pressures and blood gases 
      were made in the hagfish, Eptatretus cirrhatus, during exposure to hypoxia. The 
      partial pressure of oxygen in the medium (PIO2) was reduced from 20.7 kPa to 8.0 kPa 
      and then lowered to 5.3 kPa. At a PIO2 of 5.3 kPa there was a 40% increase in Q. 
      Part of the increase may have been due to the increased activity of the animal at 
      low PIO2. In recovery, when the animals were inactive, Q continued to rise to 160% 
      of the control values. At 5.3 kPa, oxygen consumption (as determined by the Fick 
      principle) fell to 29% of the normoxic value and was associated with increased 
      branchial vascular resistance (Rg) and an increased diffusion limitation of the 
      gills (Ldiff). Adrenaline increased heart rate and aortic blood pressures. Increased 
      Rg and Ldiff could be provoked in normoxia by the injection of the beta-adrenergic 
      blocking drug propranolol. We suggest that catecholamines may be involved in the 
      tonic control of gill vasomotor tone.

TI  - Identification of a natriuretic peptide (NP) in cyclostomes (lamprey and hagfish): 
      CNP-4 is the ancestral gene of the NP family.
PG  - 41-7
AB  - In bony fishes, natriuretic peptides (NPs) comprise a hormone family that is 
      composed of seven subtypes; ANP, BNP, VNP that have an intramolecular ring and N- 
      and C-terminal extensions, and four CNPs (CNP-1 to -4) that lack the C-terminal 
      extension. To assess the ancestral molecule of the NP family, we determined the NP 
      sequences in several species of two extant cyclosotome groups, lampreys and 
      hagfishes. A cDNA encoding CNP was cloned from the heart and brain of three 
      phylogenetically distant species of lampreys, Geotria australis, Lampetra japonica, 
      and Petromyzon marinus. In the deduced prohormone sequence of each species, two 
      potential processing signals, lysine-lysine (KK) that is commonly present in CNP 
      precursors, and arginine-X-X-arginine (RXXR) for furin-like proprotein convertase 
      (PC) that is typical for CNP-4 were present. The deduced mature peptides that are 
      released at each signal were highly conserved among three species; 100% cleaved at 
      KK and >92% processed at RXXR. In L. japonica, the CNP gene was expressed almost 
      exclusively in the heart and brain. Meanwhile, a cDNA encoding NP with a C-terminal 
      tail sequence was cloned from the heart and brain of three hagfish species in 
      different genera, Myxine glutinosa, Eptatretus cirrhatus, and Paramyxine atami. The 
      precursor sequences including the prosegment had >80% identity among the three 
      hagfish species. A processing signal, RXXR, is also conserved in the prosegment of 
      all hagfish NPs. The molecular phylogenetic analyses inferred that the lamprey CNP 
      and hagfish NP belong to the CNP-4 group, even though the hagfish NP has a 
      C-terminal sequence extended from the intramolecular ring. The presence of a 
      processing signal, RXXR, in the prosegment of cyclostome NPs supports the above 
      classification. Based on the current findings, we suggest that the ancestral gene of 
      the NP family is CNP-4.

TI  - Muscle Articulations: Flexible Jaw Joints Made of Soft Tissues.
PG  - 193-204
LID - 10.1093/icb/icv023 [doi]
AB  - This study surveys animals that use soft tissues rather than rigid links to build 
      jaw joints. Hard biting elements are useful; they are used in piercing or shearing 
      during feeding and interactive behaviors and can directly impact survival and 
      reproduction. The best understood biting systems include biting elements that are 
      mounted on rigid jaw links that form a joint capable of transmitting the bite 
      reaction forces. As such, jaws must incorporate joints that resist compression. Many 
      jaw joints are "sliding joints", in which jaw links come into direct contact and the 
      shape of the sliding contact surfaces dictates possible motions. There are, however, 
      organisms that have biting elements on jaws that are made of flexible muscle and 
      connective tissues. If arranged as a muscular hydrostat, in which multiple 
      orientations of the muscle fibers may co-contract to provide turgid skeletal 
      support, the multifunctional joint not only (a) provides the force to move the 
      biting elements, but also (b) creates repositionable pivots and (c) transmits bite 
      reaction forces. Such flexible joints, termed "muscle articulations", may be 
      important to a number of soft-bodied animals. In this survey, we review the function 
      of previously described muscle articulations: the joints found between inarticulate 
      brachiopods' valves, cephalopods' beaks, the hooks of kalyptorhynch flatworms, and 
      errant polychaetes' jaws. We also review the morphology, physiology, and feeding 
      behaviors of the hagfish as a putative muscle articulation in an effort to 
      understand how this jawless craniate is capable of biting with surprising force, 
      seemingly without the benefit of any obvious method of opposing the force of the 
      dental plate that is used to remove portions of food. Initial analysis suggests that 
      a muscle articulation may be a key feature in coordinating head and body movements 
      to provide the leverage needed for strong "bites".

TI  - Adaptations of a deep sea scavenger: high ammonia tolerance and active NH₄⁺ 
      excretion by the Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii).
PG  - 64-74
LID - S1095-6433(14)00262-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.cbpa.2014.12.010 [doi]
AB  - The Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii) has an exceptional ability to both 
      withstand and recover from exposure to high external ammonia (HEA). This tolerance 
      is likely due to the feeding behavior of this scavenger, which feeds on intermittent 
      food falls of carrion (e.g. fish, large marine mammals) during which time it may be 
      exposed to high concentrations of total ammonia (T(Amm)=NH3+NH4(+)) while burrowed 
      inside the decomposing carcass. Here we exposed hagfish to 20 mmol L(-1) T(Amm) for 
      periods of up to 48 h and then let animals recover in ammonia-free seawater. During 
      the 48 h HEA exposure period, plasma T(Amm) increased 100-fold to over 5000 μmol 
      L(-1) while ammonia excretion (J(amm)) was transiently inhibited. This increase in 
      plasma T(Amm) resulted from NH3 influx down massive inwardly directed ΔP(NH3) 
      gradients, which also led to a short-lived metabolic alkalosis. Plasma [T(Amm)] 
      stabilized after 24-48 h, possibly through a reduction in NH3 permeability across 
      the body surface, which lowered NH3 influx. Ammonia balance was subsequently 
      maintained through the re-establishment of J(amm) against an inwardly directed 
      ΔP(NH3). Calculations of the Nernst potential for ammonia strongly indicated that 
      J(amm) was also taking place against a large inwardly directed NH4(+) 
      electrochemical gradient. Recovery from HEA in ammonia-free water was characterized 
      by a large ammonia washout, and the restoration of plasma TAmm concentrations to 
      near control concentrations. Ammonia clearance was also accompanied by a residual 
      metabolic acidosis, which likely offset the ammonia-induced metabolic alkalosis seen 
      in the early stages of HEA exposure. We conclude that restoration of J(amm) by the 
      Pacific hagfish during ammonia exposure likely involves secondary active transport 
      of NH4(+), possibly mediated by Na(+)/NH4(+) (H(+)) exchange.

TI  - Sequence analysis of vasotocin cDNAs of the lamprey, Lampetra japonica, and the 
      hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri: evolution of cyclostome vasotocin precursors.
PG  - 67-77
AB  - We determined the nucleotide sequences of cDNAs encoding precursors of vasotocin 
      (VT) from two cyclostomes, the lamprey Lampetra japonica and the hagfish Eptatretus 
      burgeri, for estimation of their phylogenetic relationships. Although only 47% 
      similarity was found between the VT cDNAs, the predicted VT precursors of the 
      lamprey and the hagfish were both composed of a single peptide, VT, Gly-Lys-Arg and 
      a neurophysin, as has been shown for precursors of vasopressin (VP) family hormones, 
      including VP, VT and molluscan conopressin. The central region of the lamprey 
      neurophysin was very similar to those of previously characterized gnathostome 
      neurophysins. Conspicuously, all the positions of 14 Cys residues were conserved in 
      the lamprey neurophysin. The C-terminal region did not have a distinctive Leu-rich 
      core segment, which is always found in the glycopeptide (copeptin) moiety of VP 
      precursors. In contrast, the hagfish neurophysin showed at least two insertions and 
      one deletion in the conserved central region including 14 Cys residues, but 
      contained a potential N-linked glycosylation site and had a high proportion of Leu 
      residues in the C-terminal region, like the neurophysin of another hagfish, 
      Eptatretus stouti. The evolutionary relationships of the precursors of VP family 
      hormones among the lamprey, hagfish, gnathostomes and a mollusc were estimated by a 
      maximum likelihood method. The phylogenetic tree with the highest bootstrap 
      probability showed that the lamprey VT precursor is more closely related to the 
      gnathostome VT and VP precursors than to the hagfish VT precursors.

TI  - Primary vestibular projections in the hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri.
PG  - 73-9
AB  - The VIIIth cranial nerve projections in the hagfish, which has only one circular 
      canal in the ear, were studied by transganglionic HRP transport. This nerve has two 
      branches, the nervus utricularis (N. utr.) and the nervus saccularis (N. sac.), each 
      with its own ganglion, the ganglion utriculare (G. utr.) and the ganglion sacculare 
      (G. sac.), respectively. Although the G. sac. has uniformly small cells, the G. utr. 
      consists of two separate cell masses, a ventral mass of large cells and a dorsal 
      mass of small cells. The small cells were labeled in both ganglia after horseradish 
      peroxidase (HRP) injection into the endolymphatic space. The greater part of the 
      terminal areas of these two branches overlapped in the ventral nucleus of the area 
      acoustico-lateralis, but the terminals of the N. sac. extended slightly further in a 
      caudal direction. No projections to the primordial cerebellum and no retrogradely 
      labeled cells in the brain were found. The large cells in the ventral part of the G. 
      utr. seem to be general cutaneous neurons, and the dorsal part of the area 
      acousticolateralis seems to receive lateral line input.

TI  - Interaction of hagfish cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides with model lipid 
      membranes.
PG  - 115-20
AB  - Hagfish intestinal antimicrobial peptides (HFIAPs) are a family of polycationic 
      peptides exhibiting potent, broad-spectrum bactericidal activity. In an attempt to 
      unravel the mechanism of action of HFIAPs, we have studied their interaction with 
      model membranes. Synthetic HFIAPs selectively bound to liposomes mimicking bacterial 
      membranes, and caused the release of vesicle-encapsulated fluorescent markers in a 
      size-dependent manner. In planar lipid bilayer membranes, HFIAPs induced erratic 
      current fluctuations and reduced membrane line tension according to a general theory 
      for lipidic pores, suggesting that HFIAP pores contain lipid molecules. Consistent 
      with this notion, lipid transbilayer redistribution accompanied HFIAP pore 
      formation, and membrane monolayer curvature regulated HFIAP pore formation. Based on 
      these studies, we propose that HFIAPs kill target cells, at least in part, by 
      interacting with their plasma membrane to induce formation of lipid-containing 
      pores. Such a membrane-permeabilizing function appears to be an evolutionarily 
      conserved host-defense mechanism of antimicrobial peptides.

TI  - Transcriptome analysis of hagfish leukocytes: a framework for understanding the 
      immune system of jawless fishes.
PG  - 993-1003
AB  - Jawless fishes occupy a critical phylogenetic position in understanding the origin 
      of the adaptive immune system. Here, we performed large-scale expressed sequence tag 
      analysis of leukocytes isolated from the inshore hagfish Eptatretus burgeri. 
      Although we found many immunity-related genes such as those involved in lymphocyte 
      or hematopoietic cell signaling and development as well as cytokine and cytokine 
      receptor genes, MHC molecules or antigen receptors were not identified. We 
      characterized two hagfish cDNAs that closely resembled mammalian proteins with 
      essential roles in adaptive immunity, one encoding a GATA3-like molecule and another 
      encoding a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk)-like molecule. The GATA3-like gene of 
      hagfish was equidistant from GATA3 and GATA2 in jawed vertebrates. Similarly, the 
      hagfish Btk-like molecule was not Btk itself, but qualified as a pre-duplicated form 
      of Btk and Bmx in jawed vertebrates. In total, our work provides circumstantial 
      evidence that adaptive immunity is unique to jawed vertebrates.

TI  - Relationships between plasma concentrations of sex steroid hormones and gonadal 
      development in the brown hagfish, Paramyxine atami.
PG  - 967-74
LID - 10.2108/zsj.30.967 [doi]
AB  - The relationship between sex steroid hormone profiles in plasma and gonadal function 
      in hagfish is poorly understood. In the present study, plasma concentrations of 
      estradiol, testosterone, and progesterone were examined with respect to gonadal 
      development, sexual differences, and possible function of atretic follicles in the 
      brown hagfish, Paramyxine atami, using a time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay. Plasma 
      concentrations of these three hormones were low in juveniles of both sexes. In 
      females, plasma estradiol showed a significant correlation with ovarian development, 
      with the highest concentrations in late vitellogenic adults. Plasma testosterone and 
      progesterone also increased significantly in non-vitellogenic adult females; 
      however, plasma testosterone showed no significant differences among adult females 
      at different ovarian developments, while plasma progesterone was significantly lower 
      in late vitellogenic adults than it was in non-vitellogenic adults. Vitellogenic 
      females that possessed atretic follicles showed significantly lower concentrations 
      of all three hormones than females that only possessed normal follicles. In males, 
      no significant differences were found in plasma estradiol or testosterone levels 
      among groups of different developmental stages of the testis, while plasma 
      progesterone showed a clear inverse relationship with testicular development. Thus, 
      differences were found in plasma sex steroid hormone profiles between male and 
      female P. atami. Moreover, plasma estradiol showed a significant correlation with 
      ovarian development, which suggests that estradiol is involved in the regulation of 
      ovarian development. The present study also revealed that steroid hormone production 
      was strongly suppressed in females that possessed atretic follicles in their 
      ovaries.

TI  - Hagfish natriuretic peptide changes urine flow rates and vascular tensions in a 
      hagfish.
PG  - 45-9
LID - 10.1016/j.cbpc.2009.02.006 [doi]
AB  - Since the first report of their natriuretic effect on mammalian kidneys the relative 
      influences of natriuretic peptides (NPs) on volume and salt regulation in 
      vertebrates have been debated. As marine osmoconformers, with plasma ionic 
      concentrations similar to seawater, the actions of NPs on hagfishes may provide 
      information on their primordial role. A synthetic natriuretic peptide derived from 
      Eptatretus burgeri (hNP) increased urine production rates in E. cirrhatus at 
      3x10(-8) M. It also contracted afferent branchial and segmental arteries at low 
      concentrations (1x10(-10) M) and relaxed them at 3x10(-8) M. Thus, hNP has a renal 
      effect and at higher concentrations causes vascular relaxation suggesting a role in 
      volume regulation and the prevention of cardiac overloading. Rat ANP (rANP) 
      stimulated sodium efflux from both isolated, perfused gill pouches and the whole 
      animal. rANP also reduced subcutaneous sinus haematocrit relative to that in the 
      ventral aorta, which is consistent with a vasodilatory role.

TI  - Cardiac responses to anoxia in the Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii.
PG  - 3692-8
LID - 10.1242/jeb.046425 [doi]
AB  - In the absence of any previous study of the cardiac status of hagfishes during 
      prolonged anoxia and because of their propensity for oxygen-depleted environments, 
      the present study tested the hypothesis that the Pacific hagfish Eptatretus stoutii 
      maintains cardiac performance during prolonged anoxia. Heart rate was halved from 
      the routine value of 10.4±1.3 beats min⁻¹ by the sixth hour of an anoxic period and 
      then remained stable for a further 30 h. Cardiac stroke volume increased from 
      routine (1.3±0.1 ml kg⁻¹) to partially compensate the anoxic bradycardia, such that 
      cardiac output decreased by only 33% from the routine value of 12.3±0.9 ml min⁻¹ 
      kg⁻¹. Cardiac power output decreased by only 25% from the routine value of 0.26±0.02 
      mW g⁻¹. During recovery from prolonged anoxia, cardiac output and heart rate 
      increased to peak values within 1.5 h. Thus, the Pacific hagfish should be 
      acknowledged as hypoxic tolerant in terms of its ability to maintain around 70% of 
      their normoxic cardiac performance during prolonged anoxia. This is only the second 
      fish species to be so classified.

      what can we learn from cyclostomes?

AB  - The telencephalon, the most anterior part of the vertebrate central nervous system 
      (CNS), is a highly diversified region of the vertebrate body. Its evolutionary 
      origin remains elusive, especially with regard to the ancestral state of its 
      architecture as well as the origin of telencephalon-specific neuron subtypes. 
      Cyclostomes (lampreys and hagfish), the sister group of the gnathostomes (jawed 
      vertebrates), serve as valuable models for studying the evolution of the vertebrate 
      CNS. Here, we summarize recent studies on the development of the telencephalon in 
      the lamprey. By comparing detailed developmental studies in mammals, we illustrate a 
      possible ancestral developmental plan underlying the diversification of the 
      vertebrate telencephalon and propose possible approaches for understanding the early 
      evolution of the telencephalon.

TI  - Whole chromosome elimination and chromosome terminus elimination both contribute to 
      somatic differentiation in Taiwanese hagfish Paramyxine sheni.
PG  - 383-400
LID - 10.1007/s10577-010-9122-2 [doi]
AB  - Chromosome elimination is a process in which some chromatins are discarded from the 
      presumptive somatic cells during early embryogenesis. Eliminated chromatins in 
      hagfish generally consist of repetitive sequences, and they are highly 
      heterochromatinized in germ cells. In this study, we characterized four novel 
      eliminated DNA families, EEPs1-4, from the Taiwanese hagfish Paramyxine sheni. 
      Sequences of these four elements occupied 20-27% of eliminated DNA in total, and 
      each family was arranged mainly in tandem in the germline genome with high copy 
      numbers. Although most of these elements were eliminated, a minor fraction remained 
      in somatic cells. Some eliminated DNA families are shared as eliminated sequences 
      between Eptatretidae and Myxinidae. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of 
      these elements showed that not only heterochromatic chromosomes but also both ends 
      of euchromatic chromosomes in germ cells are absent in somatic cells of P. sheni. It 
      strongly suggests that chromosome terminus elimination, in addition to whole 
      chromosome elimination, contributes to somatic chromosome differentiation. 
      Telomere-FISH further showed that chromosome fragmentation and the subsequent de 
      novo addition of telomeric repeats are the likely mechanisms underlying chromosome 
      terminus elimination. These characteristics make it indispensable to study the 
      evolution and mechanisms underlying chromosome elimination in hagfish.

AB  - Fish epidermal mucus contains innate immune components that provide a first line of 
      defense against various infectious pathogens. This study reports the bioassay-guided 
      fractionation and characterization of a novel antimicrobial peptide, myxinidin, from 
      the acidic epidermal mucus extract of hagfish (Myxine glutinosa L.). Edman 
      sequencing and mass spectrometry revealed that myxinidin consists of 12 amino acids 
      and has a molecular mass of 1,327.68 Da. Myxinidin showed activity against a broad 
      range of bacteria and yeast pathogens at minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) 
      ranging from 1.0 to 10.0 microg/mL. Screened pathogens, Salmonella enterica serovar 
      Typhimurium C610, Escherichia coli D31, Aeromonas salmonicida A449, Yersinia ruckeri 
      96-4, and Listonella anguillarum 02-11 were found to be highly sensitive to 
      myxinidin at the MBC of 1.0-2.5 microg/mL; Staphylococcus epidermis C621 and yeast 
      (Candida albicans C627) had an MBC of 10.0 microg/mL. The antimicrobial activity of 
      myxinidin was found to be two to 16 times more active than a potent fish-derived 
      antimicrobial peptide, pleurocidin (NRC-17), against most of the screened pathogens. 
      The microbicidal activity of myxinidin was retained in the presence of sodium 
      chloride (NaCl) at concentrations up to 0.3 M and had no hemolytic activity against 
      mammalian red blood cells. These results suggest that myxinidin may have potential 
      applications in fish and human therapeutics.

AB  - The timing and sequence of events underlying the origin and early evolution of 
      vertebrates remains poorly understood. The palaeontological evidence should shed 
      light on these issues, but difficulties in interpretation of the non-biomineralized 
      fossil record make this problematic. Here we present an experimental analysis of 
      decay of vertebrate characters based on the extant jawless vertebrates (Lampetra and 
      Myxine). This provides a framework for the interpretation of the anatomy of 
      soft-bodied fossil vertebrates and putative cyclostomes, and a context for reading 
      the fossil record of non-biomineralized vertebrate characters. Decay results in 
      transformation and non-random loss of characters. In both lamprey and hagfish, 
      different types of cartilage decay at different rates, resulting in taphonomic bias 
      towards loss of 'soft' cartilages containing vertebrate-specific Col2α1 
      extracellular matrix proteins; phylogenetically informative soft-tissue characters 
      decay before more plesiomorphic characters. As such, synapomorphic decay bias, 
      previously recognized in early chordates, is more pervasive, and needs to be taken 
      into account when interpreting the anatomy of any non-biomineralized fossil 
      vertebrate, such as Haikouichthys, Mayomyzon and Hardistiella.

TI  - Conflict and resolution between phylogenies inferred from molecular and phenotypic 
      data sets for hagfish, lampreys, and gnathostomes.
PG  - 749-61
LID - 10.1002/jez.b.21293 [doi]
AB  - One of the most problematic issues in vertebrate phylogenetics is the disagreement 
      between phenotypic and molecular inferences regarding the relationships among 
      hagfishes, lampreys, and gnathostomes. Phenotypic characters support monophyly of 
      lampreys and gnathostomes, whereas nearly all published analyses of molecular data 
      sets support monophyly of hagfishes and lampreys. In this study I present results of 
      phylogenetic analyses of combined phenotypic and molecular data sets that focus on 
      relationships among hagfishes, lampreys, and gnathostomes. Maximum parsimony 
      analyses of 115 phenotypic characters combined with 4,638 rRNA sites and more than 
      10,000 amino acids each result in monophyly of lampreys and gnathostomes, 
      demonstrating that the addition of relatively few phenotypic characters can alter 
      phylogenetic inferences from large molecular data sets. On the other hand, Bayesian 
      analyses of the combined data sets support monophyly of hagfish and lampreys, 
      indicating that model-based analyses may be prone to data "swamping," where the 
      phylogenetic signal of the larger molecular data sets overwhelm the signal present 
      in the much smaller phenotypic data set. Nodes that relate hagfish and lampreys were 
      recovered at a low frequency in parametric bootstrapping analyses, indicating that 
      the timing of diversification among hagfishes, lampreys, and gnathostomes has 
      created a difficult phylogenetic problem for molecular data. The fact that addition 
      of relatively few phenotypic characters can alter phylogenetic inferences of 
      cyclostome monophyly obtained from molecular data sets, and the inability of 
      simulated data sets to recover key nodes in the craniate phylogeny provide reasons 
      to view the strong support for cyclostome monophyly inferred from molecular data 
      sets with a measured degree of skepticism.

TI  - Chemoarchitectonics of the forebrain of the hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri.
PG  - 285-98
AB  - The brain of the hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri, was investigated by enzyme 
      histochemical methods to locate roughly the areas which have somatic, visceral, and 
      correlative functions. From the results of previous investigations, it seems that, 
      as a rule, AChE is found in the correlation areas and in a part of the visceral and 
      somatic areas, whereas SDH and MAO are detected in the somatic and visceral areas, 
      respectively. Therefore, the activities of these three enzymes can be used to 
      indicate the functional areas. In addition, G6PD is used to detect areas related to 
      the pentose cycle. Areas with remarkable AChE activity are layer 4 (neuropil), layer 
      3 (perikarya), layer 5 (perikarya and neuropil), the primordium hippocampi of Jansen 
      (neuropil and a small number of perikarya), the median sagittal lamina of the 
      habenula (neuropil and perikarya), some cells in the pars dorsalis thalami of Jansen 
      (neuropil), the nucleus tuberculi posterior of Jansen (neuropil), and the 
      hypophysis. Activity of SDH, MAO, and G6PD appears in the neuropil. Regions showing 
      activity of both SDH and MAO are the olfactory nerves and glomeruli, the septal 
      area, layer 1 and 4 including the neostriatum of Crosby and Schnitzlein, the 
      primordium hippocampi of Jansen, the preotic area, the habenula, and the caudal part 
      of the medial hypothalamus, this last being the circumference of the hypothalamic 
      ventricle. Furthermore, the anterior part of the amygdala of Crosby and Schnitzlein 
      shows SDH activity. Activity of G6PD is distributed in the same regions showing 
      activity of SDH and MAO, with the exception of the primordium hippocampi of Jansen. 
      Finally, (1) two groups of continuous areas of AChE activity are found conspicuously 
      in the telencephalon; one group consists of layers 3, 4, and 5, and the other 
      consists of the ventral part of the primordium hippocampi, the lateral part of the 
      pars ventralis thalami, and the nucleus tuberculi posterior. These two groups may 
      play a correlative role between the visceral and somatic areas and the cholinergic 
      mechanisms. (2) It seems that the forebrain, especially in the hypothalamus, is 
      poorly differentiated. Furthermore, (3) a comparison with other nonmammalian brains 
      is made from the viewpoint of the chemoarchitectonics.

AB  - The form and function of the support skeleton, musculature and teeth were examined 
      in an ontogenetic series of Pacific hagfish Eptatretus stoutii spanning about a 
      six-fold range in total length (L(T)). Tooth area, feeding apparatus length, basal 
      plate size, theoretical dental plate retractile force, penetration force and applied 
      tooth stress were measured relative to body size. Morphological variables (e.g. 
      tooth area and basal plate size) scaled with positive allometry and functional 
      variables (e.g. retractile force and applied tooth stress) scaled isometrically with 
      L(T). These results suggest that juveniles do not undergo ontogenetic dietary 
      changes and consume functionally equivalent prey to adults, although adults can 
      grasp proportionally larger portions of food. Low tooth stress in juveniles and 
      adults imposes mechanical constraints to puncturing and tearing, which are 
      circumvented by a preference for softer prey tissue or the inclusion of knotting 
      behaviours for reducing tougher prey.

TI  - The mitochondrial DNA molecule of the hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) and vertebrate 
      phylogeny.
PG  - 382-8
AB  - The vertebrates are traditionally classified into two distinct groups, Agnatha 
      (jawless vertebrates) and Gnathostomata (jawed vertebrates). Extant agnathans are 
      represented by hagfishes (Myxiniformes) and lampreys (Petromyzontiformes), 
      frequently grouped together within the Cyclostomata. Whereas the recognition of the 
      Gnathostomata as a clade is commonly acknowledged, a consensus has not been reached 
      regarding whether or not Cyclostomata represents a clade. In the present study we 
      have used newly established sequences of the protein-coding genes of the 
      mitochondrial DNA molecule of the hagfish to explore agnathan and gnathostome 
      relationships. The phylogenetic analysis of Pisces, using echinoderms as outgroup, 
      placed the hagfish as a sister group of Vertebrata sensu stricto, i.e., the lamprey 
      and the gnathostomes. The phylogenetic analysis of the Gnathostomata identified a 
      basal divergence between gnathostome fishes and a branch leading to birds and 
      mammals, i.e., between "Anamnia" and Amniota. The lungfish has a basal position 
      among gnathostome fishes with the teleosts as the most recently evolving lineage. 
      The findings portray a hitherto unrecognized polarity in the evolution of bony 
      fishes. The presently established relationships are incompatible with previous 
      molecular studies.

      mucous vesicle fraction.
PG  - 103-35
AB  - This paper deals with the collection, fractionation and partial characterization of 
      the slime gland secretion of the Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stouti) with emphasis 
      on the mucous fraction. Secretions were collected by electrical stimulation of the 
      glands of anesthetized hagfish and, using three different methods, separated into 
      three fractions: 1) the thread cells, 2) the mucous vesicles of the mucous cells, 
      and 3) the soluble fraction. The methods take advantage of the stabilization of the 
      thread cells and mucous vesicles by ammonium sulfate and sodium citrate.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of immunoglobulin of hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri, a 
      primitive vertebrate.
PG  - 1091-7
AB  - The immunoglobulin of the hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri, one of the most primitive 
      vertebrates extant, was isolated from the serum of non-immune normal adult hagfish 
      in a pure form. Analysis of the immunoglobulin by sodium dodecyl 
      sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under reducing condition 
      indicated that the immunoglobulin was composed of heavy (H) and light (L) chains. 
      The mol. wt of the H-chain was 68,000, slightly smaller than that of the human 
      mu-chain. The L-chain of the immunoglobulin appeared as 2 bands on SDS-PAGE, with 
      mol. wts of 25,000 and 22,000. These findings were confirmed by gel filtration of 
      reduced-alkylated immunoglobulin in 5 M guanidine-HCl. The H:L molar ratio of the 
      immunoglobulin was roughly 1:1. Gel filtration of the immunoglobulin in 
      non-dissociating buffer indicated that the mol. wt of the intact immunoglobulin was 
      150,000-160,000. Thus, the subunit chain composition of the immunoglobulin was 
      assumed to be H2L2, identical with the fundamental structure of immunoglobulins. The 
      instability of the hagfish immunoglobulin was ascertained by the fact that it 
      dissociated into heterogeneous mol. wt components ranging from approx. 90,000 to 
      160,000 upon SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. However, almost no free or 
      monomeric H- or L-chains were dissociated from the immunoglobulin by this procedure 
      and also by gel filtration in 5 M guanidine-HCl. Theses results indicated that the 
      hagfish immunoglobulin is unusually labile in its tertiary structure but has 
      disulfide binding between at least more than 2 subunit chains.

TI  - Phylogeny of hagfish based on the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene.
PG  - 448-57
AB  - The phylogenetic relationships among the species belonging to the family Myxinidae 
      are still debatable. The mitochondrial DNA sequences from the large ribosomal RNA 
      gene may be of great value for systematic and phylogenetic studies within families. 
      Partial sequences of the 16S rRNA gene were obtained for comparisons among the 
      following hagfish species, Paramyxine nelsoni, Paramyxine sheni, Paramyxine 
      taiwanae, Paramyxine yangi, Paramyxine cheni, Eptatretus burgeri, Eptatretus stouii, 
      Eptatretus cirrhatus, Myxine glutinosa, Myxine formosana, Myxine circifrons, Myxine 
      sp1, and Myxine sp2. The boundary of four Paramyxine species (P. sheni, P. taiwanae, 
      P. nelsoni, and P. yangi) from 16S rRNA sequences is ambiguous, however, they are 
      valid based on our unpublished isozyme data as well as the gill aperture arrangement 
      pattern. Both NJ and MP trees constructed from the present molecular data indicate 
      that the genus Paramyxine is diphyletic and Eptatretus paraphyletic. The complexity 
      of Eptatretus and Paramyxine in the clade would not be solved until the farther 
      departed P. cheni is included to form a new clade under the genus Eptatretus. The 
      other clade of Myxininae contains but single genus Myxine.

TI  - Expression pattern of two collagen type 2 alpha1 genes in the Japanese inshore

      cartilaginous tissue.
PG  - 157-65
LID - 10.1002/jez.b.21322 [doi]
AB  - Collagen type 2 alpha1 (Col2A1) protein is a major component of the cartilaginous 
      extracellular matrix (ECM) in vertebrates. Over the past two decades, the 
      evolutionary origin of Col2A1 has been studied at the biochemical and molecular 
      levels in extant jawless vertebrates (hagfishes and lampreys). Although these 
      studies have contributed to our understanding of ECM protein evolution, the 
      expression profile of the Col2A1 gene in hagfishes has not been fully described. We 
      have performed molecular cloning and analyzed the gene expression pattern of the 
      Col2A1 gene in the Japanese inshore hagfish (Eptatretus burgeri). We succeeded in 
      isolating two Col2A1 genes, EbCol2A1A and EbCol2A1B, in which EbCol2A1A was 
      expressed in the noncartilaginous connective tissues whereas EbCol2A1B was detected 
      in some cartilaginous elements. Based on these results, we discuss the evolutionary 
      history of Col2A1 genes in early vertebrates.

AB  - The retinal projections of hagfish were investigated by anterograde transport of HRP 
      and the Nauta-Gygax method. The pathway coincided with the commissura postoptica of 
      Jansen after complete crossing within the hypothalamus. Many projections were found 
      in the contralateral 'area pretectalis', but there were only a few projections in 
      the tectum mesencephali, the pars ventralis thalami, and the n. tuberculi 
      posterioris of Jansen.

TI  - Primary structures of somatostatins from the islet organ of the hagfish suggest an 
      anomalous pathway of posttranslational processing of prosomatostatin-1.
PG  - 1855-9
AB  - The cyclostomes represent the first class of vertebrate in evolution to develop an 
      endocrine pancreas. Two peptides with somatostatin-like immunoreactivity were 
      isolated from the islet organ of one such cyclostome, the Atlantic hagfish (Myxine 
      glutinosa). The primary structure of the more abundant peptide was established as: 
      Ala-Val-Glu-Arg-Pro5-Arg-Gln-Asp-Gly-Gln10-Val-His-Glu-Pro- 
      Pro15-Gly-Arg-Glu-Arg-Lys20-Ala-Gly-Cys-Lys-Asn25-Phe- 
      Phe-Trp-Lys-Thr30-Phe-Thr-Ser-Cys. The second peptide, comprising 27% of the total 
      immunoreactivity in the islet extract, was identical to mammalian somatostatin-14. 
      The pathway of posttranslational processing of prosomatostatin in the hagfish islet 
      differs markedly from the pathway in the higher vertebrates. In the mammalian 
      pancreas, prosomatostatin is cleaved at the site of the single arginyl residue 
      (corresponding to position 6 in hagfish somatostatin-34) and at the arginine-lysine 
      site (corresponding to positions 19 and 20 in the hagfish peptide) to generate 
      somatostatin-14 and somatostatin-28(1-12)-peptide. In the hagfish islet, Arg6 is not 
      used as a cleavage site and cleavage at Arg19-Lys20 represents only a minor pathway 
      of processing. The data provide further evidence of the strong evolutionary pressure 
      to conserve the complete amino acid sequence of somatostatin-14.

AB  - Extant vertebrates are divided into the two major groups, cyclostomes and 
      gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates). The former includes jawless fishes, hagfishes and 
      lampreys, and the latter includes all extant jawed vertebrates. In many research 
      fields, the phenotypic traits of the cyclostomes have been considered crucial in 
      understanding the evolutionary process from invertebrates to vertebrates. Recent 
      studies have suggested that the common ancestor of the extant vertebrates including 
      hagfishes and lampreys underwent two-round of whole genome duplications, and thus 
      the genome expansion solely does not account for phenotypic differences between 
      cyclostomes and gnathostomes. Emerging evidence from molecular phylogeny of 
      individual gene families indicates that the gene repertoire expanded at the common 
      ancestor of vertebrates were later reshaped asymmetrically between the two lineages, 
      resulting in the retention of differential gene sets. This also confuses 
      interpretation of conserved synteny which often serves as indicator of orthology and 
      the ploidy level. In this review, current controversy and future perspectives of 
      cyclostome genomics are discussed with reference to evolutionary developmental 
      biology.

TI  - Molecular design of the alpha-keratin composite: insights from a matrix-free model, 
      hagfish slime threads.
PG  - 291-9
AB  - We performed mechanical tests on a matrix-free keratin model-hagfish slime 
      threads-to test the hypothesis that intermediate filaments (IFs) in hydrated hard 
      alpha-keratins are maintained in a partly dehydrated state. This hypothesis predicts 
      that dry IFs should possess mechanical properties similar to the properties of 
      hydrated hard alpha-keratins, and should swell more than hard alpha-keratins in 
      water. Mechanical and swelling measurements of hagfish threads were consistent with 
      both of these predictions, suggesting that an elastomeric keratin matrix resists IF 
      swelling and keeps IF stiffness and yield stress high. The elastomeric nature of the 
      matrix is indirectly supported by the inability of matrix-free IFs (i.e. slime 
      threads) to recover from post-yield deformation. We propose a general conceptual 
      model of the structural mechanics of IF-based materials that predicts the effects of 
      hydration and cross-linking on stiffness, yield stress and extensibility.

TI  - Distinct non-collagen based cartilages comprising the endoskeleton of the Atlantic 
      hagfish, Myxine glutinosa.
PG  - 281-90
AB  - Previous evidence from our laboratories showed that collagen is not the major matrix 
      protein of the cartilaginous endoskeleton of the lamprey (Petromyzon marinus). Here 
      we have characterized the cartilage matrix proteins of the only other extant 
      agnathan, the hagfish (Myxine glutinosa). Using morphological, immunochemical and 
      biochemical methods, we show that the structural proteins of the cartilaginous 
      endoskeleton of the hagfish are also non-collagenous in nature. Although these 
      hagfish cartilage proteins share properties both with each other and with lamprey 
      cartilage proteins, including resistance to solubilization with cyanogen bromide and 
      an usual amino acid composition rich in glycine and non-polar amino acids, it is 
      clear that at least two and probably more hagfish cartilage proteins can be 
      distinguished, with distinct distributions in different cartilage structures. 
      Furthermore, in spite of their similarities, matrix proteins from hagfish cartilage 
      are not identical to the proteins we have previously characterized in lamprey 
      cartilage. These results suggest the existence of a larger family of similar but not 
      identical proteins that form the major structural elements of cartilage tissues of 
      agnathans. These data also support our previous conclusion that type II collagen 
      became the predominant structural protein of cartilage only after the divergence of 
      the agnathans from the ancestral line of the vertebrates.

TI  - Ventilation in Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii) during exposure to acute hypoxia 
      or hypercapnia.
PG  - 227-34
LID - 10.1016/j.resp.2009.04.025 [doi]
AB  - A technique was developed to measure ventilation in unrestrained Pacific hagfish 
      (Eptatretus stoutii) by inserting and fastening into the nostril a flexible tube 
      fitted with an ultrasonic flow probe. This technique permitted the continuous 
      measurement of ventilation (respiratory) frequency (fR), stroke volume and minute 
      ventilation (.V(E)) in real time in fish exposed to acute hypoxia or hypercapnia. 
      Exposing fish to acute hypoxia (final PW(O2)=21.0 +/- 3.4 mm Hg) caused hypoxaemia 
      and a marked increase in .V(E) of 350+/-71 ml min(-1)kg(-1) (from 235 to 585 ml 
      min(-1)kg(-1)) owing exclusively to an increase in fR of 44+/-7 min(-1) (from 19 to 
      63 min(-1)). Because O(2) consumption (approximately 0.4 mmol kg(-1)h(-1)) was 
      unaltered during hypoxia, there was an associated marked increase in the ventilation 
      convection requirement from 36.7 to 81.8l mmol(-1). Injecting the O(2) chemoreceptor 
      stimulant NaCN into inspired water (external CN-) or pre-branchial blood (internal 
      CN-) evoked ventilatory responses that were similar to those observed during hypoxia 
      although of a lesser magnitude. With external CN(-), V (E) increased maximally by 
      146+/-46 ml min(-1)kg(-1) and fR increased by 20+/-2 min(-1). With internal CN-, the 
      maximal increase in .V(E) was 93+/-30 ml min(-1)kg(-1) and fR increased maximally by 
      19+/-6 min(-1). Exposure to acute hypercapnia (final PwC=7.0+/-0.2 mmHg) caused an 
      increase in V (E) of 169+/-60 ml min(-1)kg(-1). These results provide compelling 
      evidence for chemoreceptor-mediated control of breathing in hagfish and suggest that 
      ventilatory responses to environmental hypoxia and hypercapnia in the vertebrates 
      arose in the myxine lineage.

TI  - Phosphoglucose isomerases of hagfish, zebrafish, gray mullet, toad, and snake, with 
      reference to the evolution of the genes in vertebrates.
PG  - 367-74
AB  - Phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) is a protein with multiple functions. To infer its 
      structure changes and evolution in vertebrates, we cloned cDNAs encoding PGI genes 
      from hagfish (Paramyxine yangi), gray mullet (Mugil cephalus), zebrafish (Danio 
      rerio), toad (Bufo melanosticus), and snake (Boiga kraepelini). Only one PGI gene 
      was cloned in each of hagfish, toad, and snake, but two PGI genes were found in 
      zebrafish and gray mullet, respectively. The PGI of hagfish encodes 554 amino acids, 
      in contrast to the PGIs of bonyfishes, toad, and snake which encode 553 amino acids 
      and the PGIs of mammals which encode 558 amino acids. Among 558 aligned amino acid 
      sites, there are 314 sites (56.27%) totally conserved. To see if diversifying 
      selection acts on PGI amino acids of vertebrates, we calculated the pairwise ratio 
      of nonsynonymous versus synonymous substitution per site (Ka/Ks) and the ratio of 
      radical amino acid changes versus conservative amino acid changes per sites (dR/dC) 
      between PGI sequences. The average pairwise ratio between nonsynonymous 
      substitutions per nucleotide (Ka) and synonymous substitutions per nucleotide (Ks) 
      among vertebrate PGI sequences equals 0.047 +/- 0.019. The average pairwise ratio 
      between radical amino acid changes and conservative amino acid changes (dR/dC) among 
      the vertebrate PGIs equal 0.938 +/- 0.158 for charge changes, 0.558 +/- 0.085 for 
      polarity changes, and 0.465 +/- 0.0714 when both polarity and volume are considered. 
      There is no amino acid within the vertebrate PGIs under diversifying selection as 
      analyzed by the method of Yang et al. (2000b). The results suggest that the present 
      vertebrate PGIs are at evolutionary stasis and are being subjected to intense 
      purifying selection. The purifying selection is to maintain polarity and volume of 
      the protein but not the charge groups of amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis reveals 
      that vertebrate PGIs can be classified into three major groups: the mammalian, 
      amphibian-reptilian, and teleostean PGIs. The gene tree suggests that the gene 
      duplication event of PGI in bonyfishes occurred before diversification of 
      Acanthopterygii but after the split of bonyfishes and tetrapods. The evolution of 
      multiple functions of PGI is discussed.

TI  - V-H(+)-ATPase, Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and NHE2 immunoreactivity in the gill epithelium of 
      the Pacific hagfish (Epatretus stoutii).
PG  - 312-21
AB  - We report the presence of the ion transporting proteins V-H(+)-ATPase, 
      Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and NHE2 in the gill epithelium of the Pacific hagfish Epatretus 
      stoutii. Heterologous antibodies recognized single bands of the appropriate sizes 
      for the three transporters in western blots. Immunohistochemical staining revealed 
      that the distribution of labeled cells in the gill epithelium was identical for the 
      three proteins. Immunopositive cells were most abundant in the primary filament from 
      the afferent side of the gill pouch, and their number diminished towards the 
      lamella. Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase-like immunoreactivity (L-IR) occurred throughout the cell 
      cytoplasm, probably associated to the basolateral tubular system. V-H(+)-ATPase L-IR 
      was similar to Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, although some cells had slightly heavier staining 
      in either the supra- or infra-nuclear region. NHE2 L-IR was also generally 
      cytoplasmic, but a minority of the cells had stronger immunoreactivity in the apical 
      region. In general, all three ion transporting proteins were localized in the same 
      cells, as estimated from 4-microm immunostained consecutive sections. We hypothesize 
      that these putative ion-transporting cells are involved in systemic acid/base 
      regulation and discuss other possible roles. This is the first report of 
      V-H(+)-ATPase in myxinoids, and the first NHE2 report in the Pacific hagfish.

TI  - Plasma cells in adult Atlantic hagfish, Myxine glutinosa.

AB  - Hagfishes, the most primitive vertebrates, are of special interest for the evolution 
      of immune responses. Eptatretus stoutii, the Pacific hagfish, is able to mount 
      cellular and humoral immune responses but all attempts to demonstrate in them the 
      presence of plasma cells have failed. In the present study we demonstrate for the 
      first time plasma cells identifiable by ultrastructural criteria in the pronephros, 
      a primitive lymphohaemopoietic organ, of Myxine glutinosa, the Atlantic hagfish.

TI  - Maturation of hagfish gland thread cells: composition and characterization of 
      intermediate filament polypeptides.
PG  - 31-45
AB  - Previous studies with the hagfish, a primitive vertebrate, have shown that the gland 
      thread cells (GTCs) each contain a single thread (approximately 60 cm long in 
      average-sized cells) in the form of a concisely coiled cytoskeletal entity destined 
      for export by holocrine secretion. The thread in relatively immature GTCs consists 
      almost entirely of intermediate filaments (IFs) bundled in parallel alignment with 
      far fewer microtubules (MTs). The three thread polypeptides described earlier 
      (alpha, basic; beta, acidic; gamma, most acidic; each with a Mr of 63-64 kD) are now 
      further evaluated with respect to in vitro assembly, cross-reactivity with IF 
      polypeptides from higher vertebrates, and peptide sequence homology with known IF 
      polypeptides. The overall results mainly suggest that the hagfish polypeptides are 
      keratinlike substances but lamins or a new type of IF is not ruled out. However, 
      cross-reactivity is weak with mammalian keratins; the 8-11-nm filaments formed from 
      mixtures of alpha and gamma in vitro are generally linear rather than the 
      curvilinear structures usually formed by keratin and nonkeratin IFs; and mixtures of 
      alpha and beta tend to yield 9-12-nm granules or granular strings. Polypeptide 
      analyses on GTCs segregated on the basis of maturational stage show a progressive 
      increase in beta/gamma values which correlates with cell maturation, but the 
      alpha/(beta + gamma) ratios remain near 1. Inasmuch as beta and gamma have many 
      similar properties, the documented increase in the amount of the beta component in 
      aging GTCs might in part be the result of a failure in a posttranslational 
      modification system and may contribute to the ultrastructural changes that accompany 
      thread maturation in preparation for holocrine secretion and subsequent modulation 
      of the viscoelastic properties of mucus.

TI  - Overview of the transcriptome profiles identified in hagfish, shark, and bichir: 
      current issues arising from some nonmodel vertebrate taxa.
PG  - 526-46
LID - 10.1002/jez.b.21427 [doi]
AB  - Because of their crucial phylogenetic positions, hagfishes, sharks, and bichirs are 
      recognized as key taxa in our understanding of vertebrate evolution. The expression 
      patterns of the regulatory genes involved in developmental patterning have been 
      analyzed in the context of evolutionary developmental studies. However, in a survey 
      of public sequence databases, we found that the large-scale sequence data for these 
      taxa are still limited. To address this deficit, we used conventional Sanger DNA 
      sequencing and a next-generation sequencing technology based on 454 GS FLX 
      sequencing to obtain expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of the Japanese inshore hagfish 
      (Eptatretus burgeri; 161,482 ESTs), cloudy catshark (Scyliorhinus torazame; 165,819 
      ESTs), and gray bichir (Polypterus senegalus; 34,336 ESTs). We deposited the ESTs in 
      a newly constructed database, designated the "Vertebrate TimeCapsule." The ESTs 
      include sequences from genes that can be effectively used in evolutionary 
      developmental studies; for instance, several encode cartilaginous extracellular 
      matrix proteins, which are central to an understanding of the ways in which 
      evolutionary processes affected the skeletal elements, whereas others encode 
      regulatory genes involved in craniofacial development and early embryogenesis. Here, 
      we discuss how hagfishes, sharks, and bichirs contribute to our understanding of 
      vertebrate evolution, we review the current status of the publicly available 
      sequence data for these three taxa, and we introduce our EST projects and newly 
      developed database.

PG  - 107-11
LID - 10.1016/j.cbpc.2008.04.004 [doi]
AB  - We used myography on five different arteries and three veins of the hagfish, 
      Eptatretus cirrhatus, to test the response of vessels to vasoactive drugs. 
      Concentration-response curves were generated for carbachol, endothelin-1, arginine 
      vasotocin and the adrenergic agonists, phenylephrine and isoprenaline. pEC50 values 
      indicated that veins were more sensitive to endothelin-1 than were arteries, but the 
      arteries were more sensitive to the cholinergic agonist, carbachol. Segmental 
      arteries did not react to arginine vasotocin, but all other vessels did, and on a 
      molar basis it was the most potent agonist tested. That ventral and dorsal aortas 
      were more sensitive to arginine vasotocin than smaller vessels might indicate that 
      this neurohypophysial peptide has the potential to exert a profound influence on 
      branchial vascular resistance and cardiac output in hagfishes. The results also 
      demonstrate the potential for a variety of endogenous peptides to contribute to 
      central venous tone.

TI  - Time scale for cyclostome evolution inferred with a phylogenetic diagnosis of 
      hagfish and lamprey cDNA sequences.
PG  - 1053-64
AB  - The Cyclostomata consists of the two orders Myxiniformes (hagfishes) and 
      Petromyzoniformes (lampreys), and its monophyly has been unequivocally supported by 
      recent molecular phylogenetic studies. Under this updated vertebrate phylogeny, we 
      performed in silico evolutionary analyses using currently available cDNA sequences 
      of cyclostomes. We first calculated the GC-content at four-fold degenerate sites 
      (GC(4)), which revealed that an extremely high GC-content is shared by all the 
      lamprey species we surveyed, whereas no striking pattern in GC-content was observed 
      in any of the hagfish species surveyed. We then estimated the timing of 
      diversification in cyclostome evolution using nucleotide and amino acid sequences. 
      We obtained divergence times of 470-390 million years ago (Mya) in the 
      Ordovician-Silurian-Devonian Periods for the interordinal split between Myxiniformes 
      and Petromyzoniformes; 90-60 Mya in the Cretaceous-Tertiary Periods for the split 
      between the two hagfish subfamilies, Myxininae and Eptatretinae; 280-220 Mya in the 
      Permian-Triassic Periods for the split between the two lamprey subfamilies, 
      Geotriinae and Petromyzoninae; and 30-10 Mya in the Tertiary Period for the split 
      between the two lamprey genera, Petromyzon and Lethenteron. This evolutionary 
      configuration indicates that Myxiniformes and Petromyzoniformes diverged shortly 
      after the common ancestor of cyclostomes split from the future gnathostome lineage. 
      Our results also suggest that intra-subfamilial diversification in hagfish and 
      lamprey lineages (especially those distributed in the northern hemisphere) occurred 
      in the Cretaceous or Tertiary Periods.

TI  - Chromatin diminution and chromosome elimination in four Japanese hagfish species.
PG  - 196-8
AB  - Cytogenetic examination of four Japanese hagfish species belonging to the order 
      Myxinida (Eptatretus okinoseanus, E. burgeri. Paramyxine atami, and Myxine garmani) 
      revealed differences in chromosome number between germ cells (spermatocytes and 
      spermatogonia) and somatic cells (liver, blood, gill, and kidney). The differences 
      in chromosome number between spermatogonia (54, 52, 48, and 16) and somatic cells 
      (34, 36, 34, and 14) were 20, 16, 14, and 2 in E. okinoseanus, E. burgeri, P. atami, 
      and M. garmani, respectively. The amount of DNA in a somatic cell (2C) relative to 
      that in a germ cell (2C) averaged 54.6% (E. okinoseanus type A), 44.9% (E. 
      okinoseanus type B), 79.1% (E. burgeri), 60.0% (P. atami), and 70.2% (M. garmani). 
      These results clearly indicate that chromosome elimination takes place during early 
      cleavage in the four hagfish species of Myxinida living in Japanese waters, except 
      in the ancestral germline cells. C-banding of metaphase chromosome preparations of 
      germline and somatic cells from each hagfish species revealed that the 
      C-band-positive chromatin in the ancestral somatic cells had been almost completely 
      eliminated. Three patterns of elimination of this chromatin are discussed.

      advances the field of research on body size and depth of occurrence in fishes by 
      including a phylogenetic correction and by examining depth in four ways: maximum 
      depth, minimum depth, mean depth of recorded specimens and the average of maximum 
      and minimum depths of occurrence. Results yield no evidence for Heincke's law in 
      hagfishes, no phylogenetic signal for the depth at which species occur, but moderate 
      to weak phylogenetic signal for body size, suggesting that phylogeny may play a role 
      in determining body size in this group.

AB  - Interest in understanding the transition from prevertebrates to vertebrates at the 
      molecular level has resulted in accumulating genomic and transcriptomic sequence 
      data for the earliest groups of extant vertebrates, namely, hagfishes (Myxiniformes) 
      and lampreys (Petromyzontiformes). Molecular phylogenetic studies on species 
      phylogeny have revealed the monophyly of cyclostomes and the deep divergence between 
      hagfishes and lampreys (more than 400 million years). In parallel, recent molecular 
      phylogenetic studies have shed light on the complex evolution of the cyclostome 
      genome. This consists of whole genome duplications, shared at least partly with 
      gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates), and cyclostome lineage-specific secondary 
      modifications of the genome, such as gene gains and losses. Therefore, the analysis 
      of cyclostome genomes requires caution in distinguishing between orthology and 
      paralogy in gene molecular phylogeny at the gene family scale, as well as between 
      apomorphic and plesiomorphic genomic traits in larger-scale analyses. In this 
      review, we propose possible ways of improving the resolvability of these 
      evolutionary events, and discuss probable scenarios for cyclostome genome evolution, 
      with special emphasis on the hypothesis that two-round (2R) genome duplication 
      events occurred before the divergence between cyclostomes and gnathostomes, and 
      therefore that a post-2R state is a genomic synapomorphy for all extant vertebrates.

TI  - The absence of an arterial pressure effect on filtration by perfused glomeruli of 
      the hagfish, Eptatretus stouti (Lockington).
PG  - 361-74
AB  - Single renal corpuscles of hagfish were perfused with a Ringer solution containing 
      Ficoll 70 to simulate the colloid osmotic pressure of hagfish plasma. Simultaneous 
      measurements were made of single glomerulus filtration rate (SGFR), perfusion 
      pressure and the pressure in a vessel of the renal vasculature. The results confirm 
      that SGFR is independent of pressure in the glomerular capillaries (PGC). The 
      results also suggest that flow through glomeruli and SGFR are closely linked. 
      Studies of the pressures in glomerular capillaries during periods when the perfusion 
      rate was varied indicate that PGC reflects the area of the active capillaries and 
      the rate of perfusion. Therefore, in the hagfish, PGC appears to be an effect of 
      factors that cause glomerular filtration, not the main cause of that process.

AB  - The origin of paired fins has long been a focus of both paleontologists and 
      developmental biologists. Fossil records indicate that the first pair of fin-like 
      structures emerged in the body wall of early vertebrates. However, extant agnathan 
      lampreys and hagfishes lack paired fins, and thus it has been difficult to determine 
      the developmental processes underlying the ancestral acquisition of paired fins in 
      vertebrates. Fortunately, recent advances in our knowledge of the developmental 
      mechanisms of the lateral plate mesoderm among different taxa have provided clues 
      for understanding the evolutionary origin of vertebrate paired appendages.

TI  - Isolation of a hagfish gene that encodes a complement component.
PG  - 829-37
AB  - It has been widely accepted that cyclostomes are the most primitive vertebrates 
      extant with the ability to produce antibodies. We isolated cDNA clones that encode a 
      putative 'antibody' from one of the cyclostomes, Eptatretus burgeri. The amino acid 
      sequence predicted from the nucleotide sequences of the cDNA clones indicated that 
      this gene does actually encode the proteins isolated as hagfish 'antibodies' by 
      various investigators. However, these proteins are not similar to mammalian 
      immunoglobulins but have some characteristics common to complements C3, C4 and C5 in 
      higher vertebrates. We discuss the relationships of the isolated gene for hagfish 
      complement with the mammalian genes for complements C3, C4 and C5. We also discuss 
      the possibility of the presence of antibodies in cyclostomes.

      (Myxinoidea).
PG  - 315-28
AB  - The retinofugal and retinopetal connections of the Pacific hagfish were determined 
      using the fluorescent compound DiI as an in vitro tracer. The retinofugal 
      connections were found to be bilateral and to reach preoptic, thalamic and 
      pretectal, as well as tectal, targets. No distinct basal optic root was found. A 
      retinopetal projection in hagfishes is described here for the first time. It 
      originates from two cells groups in the rostral mesencephalic tegmentum. These 
      retinal connections in hagfishes are compared to the organization of the visual 
      system in the second Recent group of jawless fishes, the lampreys. Both visual 
      systems are similar in the number and location of the targets of retinal fibers. 
      Furthermore, there is a striking similarity in the retinopetal systems. Major 
      differences are found in the organization of the optic tract. These observations 
      allow the identification of some cell groups not previously recognized in myxinoid 
      brains or interpreted differently. Finally, the findings are discussed in relation 
      to visually guided behavior in hagfishes.

      Over 70% of the small leucocyte population consistently stained with a rabbit 
      antiserum directed against polypeptide determinants on hagfish immunoglobulin, while 
      staining of the large cell population was greatly reduced (less than 10%). A panel

      distinguished the two cell populations and revealed the existence of subpopulations 
      of both small and large leucocytes.

      the developmental evolution of early vertebrates.

AB  - Lampreys and hagfishes are the only surviving relicts of an ancient but ecologically 
      dominant group of jawless fishes that evolved in the seas of the Cambrian era over 
      half a billion years ago. Because of their phylogenetic position as the sister group 
      to all other vertebrates (jawed vertebrates), comparisons of embryonic development 
      between jawless and jawed vertebrates offers researchers in the field of 
      evolutionary developmental biology the unique opportunity to address fundamental 
      questions related to the nature of our earliest vertebrate ancestors. Here, we 
      describe how genetic analysis of embryogenesis in the sea lamprey (Petromyzon 
      marinus) has provided insight into the origin and evolution of developmental-genetic 
      programs in vertebrates. We focus on recent work involving CRISPR/Cas9-mediated 
      genome editing to study gene regulatory mechanisms involved in the development and 
      evolution of neural crest cells and new cell types in the vertebrate nervous system, 
      and transient transgenic assays that have been instrumental in dissecting the 
      evolution of cis-regulatory control of gene expression in vertebrates. Finally, we 
      discuss the broad potential for these functional genomic tools to address previously 
      unanswerable questions related to the evolution of genomic regulatory mechanisms as 
      well as issues related to invasive sea lamprey population control.

      the glossopharyngeal-vagal nerve trunk, in the saccular ganglion, and in the 
      brainstem. Afferent fibers of the glossopharyngeal-vagal nerve terminate in both the 
      vagal lobe and the fasciculus communis. Close observation showed no morphological 
      differentiation between these two structures, indicating that they are not separate 
      entities, but a single, continuous structure that is homologous with the nucleus and 
      tractus solitarius of other vertebrates. The median part of this structure (the 
      commissura infima) is displaced more rostrally than the same part of the solitary 
      nucleus in many other vertebrates. Some of the afferent fibers invade the ventral 
      portion of the trigeminal sensory nucleus, which receives the maxillo-mandibular 
      nerve fibers, and terminate there. Our study showed that the hagfish has only one 
      nucleus in the vagal motor system, i.e., the vagal motor nucleus, which contains 
      both parasympathetic and branchiomotor neurons. The dendrites of the vagal motor 
      neurons in the hagfish are more highly developed than those in other vertebrates. 
      This suggests that the motor reflex arc of the glossopharyngeal-vagal nerve in 
      hagfishes may be simpler than in other vertebrates.

AB  - Visual ecology or the relationship between the visual system of an animal and its 
      environment has proven to be a crucial research field for establishing general 
      concepts of adaptation, specialization and evolution. The visual neuroscientist is 
      indeed confronted with a plethora of different visual characteristics, each 
      seemingly optimised for each species' ecological niche, but often without a clear 
      understanding of the evolutionary constraints at play. However, before we are able 
      to fully understand the influence(s) of ecology and phylogeny on visual system 
      design in vertebrates, it is first necessary to understand the basic bauplan of key 
      representatives of each taxa. This review examines photoreception in hagfishes, 
      lampreys, cartilaginous fishes and lungfishes with an eye to their ecology using a 
      range of neurobiological methods including anatomy, microspectrophotometry and 
      molecular genetics. These early vertebrates represent critical stages in evolution 
      and surprisingly possess a level of visual complexity that is almost unrivalled in 
      other vertebrates.

TI  - Telencephalic connections in the Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stouti), with special 
      reference to the thalamopallial system.
PG  - 245-60
AB  - The pallium of hagfishes (myxinoids) is unique: It consists of a superficial 
      "cortical" mantle of gray matter which is subdivided into several layers and fields, 
      but it is not clear whether or how these subdivisions can be compared to those of 
      other craniates, i.e., lampreys and gnathostomes. The pallium of hagfishes receives 
      extensive secondary olfactory projections (Wicht and Northcutt [1993] J. Comp. 
      Neurol. 337:529-542), but there are no experimental data on its nonolfactory 
      connections. We therefore investigated the pallial and dorsal thalamic connections 
      of the Pacific hagfish. Injections of tracers into the pallium labeled many cells 
      bilaterally in the olfactory bulbs. Other pallial afferents arise from the 
      contralateral pallium, the dorsal thalamic nuclei, the preoptic region, and the 
      posterior tubercular nuclei. Descending pallial efferents reach the preoptic region, 
      the dorsal thalamus, and the mesencephalic tectum but not the motor or premotor 
      centers of the brainstem. Injections of tracers into the dorsal thalamus confirmed 
      the presence of reciprocal thalamopallial connections. In addition, these injections 
      revealed that there is no "preferred" pallial target for the ascending thalamic 
      fibers; instead, ascending thalamic and secondary olfactory projections overlap 
      throughout the pallium. The mesencephalic tectum and tegmentum, which receive 
      afferents from a variety of sensory sources, are interconnected with the dorsal 
      thalamus; thus, ascending nonolfactory sensory information may reach myxinoid pallia 
      via a tectal-thalamic-telencephalic route. A comparative analysis of pallial 
      organization reveals that the subdivisions of the pallium in gnathostomes (i.e., 
      medial, dorsal, and lateral pallia) cannot be recognized with certainty in 
      hagfishes.

PG  - 634-41
AB  - The complete sequence of the mitochondrial DNA of the hagfish Myxine glutinosa has 
      been determined. The hagfish mtDNA (18,909 bp) is the longest vertebrate mtDNA 
      determined so far. The gene arrangement conforms to the consensus vertebrate type 
      and differs from that of lampreys. The exceptionally long (3628-bp) control region 
      of the hagfish contains the typical conserved elements found in other vertebrate 
      mtDNAs but is characterized by a large number of putative hairpins, which can 
      potentially fold into a highly compact secondary structure that appears to be unique 
      to hagfish. The comparison of the mtDNAs of two M. glutinosa specimens, excluding 
      the control region, shows a 0.6% divergence at the nucleotide level as a sample of 
      intraspecies polymorphism.

TI  - Purification and properties of cyclostome carbonic anhydrase from erythrocytes of 
      hagfish.
PG  - 160-70
AB  - 1. Carbonic anhydrase (carbonate hydro-lyase, EC 4.2.1.1) has been purified from 
      erythrocytes of hagfish (Myxine glutinosa). A single form with low specific CO2 
      hydration activity was isolated. The purified carbonic anhydrase appeared 
      homogeneous judging from polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration 
      experiments. The protein has a molecular weight of about 29 000, corresponding to 
      about 260 amino acid residues. This molecular weight is in accordance with other 
      vertebrate carbonic anhydrases with the exception of the elasmobranch enzymes, which 
      have Mr 36 000--39 000. 2. The molecular weight obtained for hagfish carbonic 
      anhydrase indicates that a carbonic anhydrase with Mr approx. 29 000 is the 
      ancestral type of the vertebrate enzyme rather than, as in sharks, a heavier 
      carbonic anhydrase molecule. 3. The circular dichroism spectrum may indicate a 
      somewhat different structural arrangement of aromatic amino acid residues in this 
      enzyme than in the mammalian carbonic anhydrases. 4. The enzyme is strongly 
      inhibited by acetazolamide and also to a lesser extent by monovalent anions. 5. 
      Zn2+, which is essential for activity, appears, contrary to other characterized 
      carbonic anhydrases, less strongly bound in the active site of the enzyme.

TI  - Construction of a bacterial artificial chromosome library from the inshore hagfish, 
      Eptatretus burgeri: A resource for the analysis of the agnathan genome.
PG  - 251-3
AB  - The jawless fish occupy an important phylogenetic position for understanding the 
      evolution of body plans, the origin of adaptive immunity and genome evolution in 
      chordates. We describe here the construction of a large-insert bacterial artificial 
      chromosome (BAC) library from the inshore hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri. The BAC 
      library contains 93,978 clones with an average insert size of 100 kb and is 
      estimated to represent threefold genome-equivalent coverage. The library was 
      organized in three-dimensional pools to facilitate screening by PCR. We have 
      screened this library by PCR and isolated several BAC clones; the average number of 
      positive clones was compatible with the estimated genome coverage of the library. 
      This BAC library, constructed for the first time from the jawless fish, should serve 
      as a useful resource for the scientific community.

TI  - Localization and partial characterization of melatonin receptors in amphioxus, 
      hagfish, lamprey, and skate.
PG  - 67-78
AB  - Through its secretion of melatonin, the pineal complex of vertebrates exerts a range 
      of physiological effects including regulation of circadian rhythms, seasonal 
      reproduction, metamorphosis, and body color change. Little is known about 
      phylogenetic differences in the distribution and characteristics of melatonin 
      binding sites in fishes. We used in vitro autoradiography to examine binding of 
      [2-125I]iodomelatonin (IMEL) in 20-micron frozen sections of amphioxus 
      (Branchiostoma lanceolatum), Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa), larval and adult 
      lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), little skate (Raja erinacea), and rainbow trout 
      (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Tissue was incubated with IMEL in the presence or absence of 
      unlabeled melatonin (1 muM, in order to assess nonspecific binding). A concentration 
      of 32 pM IMEL was used for single point assays and competition studies. No specific 
      binding was found in hagfish or amphioxus, which lack a pineal complex. In the optic 
      tecta of lamprey, skate, and trout, IMEL binding is highly specific (melatonin >> 
      N-acetylserotonin > 5- methoxytryptophol >> serotonin). Scatchard analysis revealed 
      that the tectal binding sites are of high affinity (Kd = 36, 38, and 50 pM) and low 
      capacity (Bmax = 8.1, 19.8, and 21.8 fmol/mg protein) in lamprey, skate, and trout, 
      respectively. In adult lampreys, intense specific IMEL binding is found in the optic 
      tectum (layer I > II > III) and preoptic nucleus (pars parvocellularis > 
      magnocellularis). Binding was less intense and consistent in the same areas of 
      ammocoete brain. In skates and trout, intense specific binding is found in optic 
      tectum, lateral geniculate body, diencephalic preoptic and suprachiasmatic nuclei, 
      basal hypothalamus, and the medial pallium. These results indicate that specific 
      melatonin binding sites are present in all craniate taxa examined except in hagfish. 
      Although we cannot rule out the possibility that melatonin receptors are secondarily 
      lost in hagfish, their absence in amphioxus makes this unlikely. We speculate that 
      melatonin actions in early vertebrates may have included regulation of visual and 
      endocrine responses to light.

TI  - Cerebrospinal fluid contacting neurons in the reduced brain ventricular system of 
      the atlantic hagfish, Myxine glutinosa.
PG  - 35-44
AB  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-contacting neurons are sensory-type cells sending ciliated 
      dendritic process into the CSF. Some of the prosencephalic CSF-contacting neurons of 
      higher vertebrates were postulated to be chemoreceptors detecting the chemical 
      composition of the CSF, other cells may percieve light as "deep encephalic 
      photoreceptors". In our earlier works, CSF-contacting neurons of the 
      mechanoreceptor-type were described around the central canal of the hagfish spinal 
      cord. It was supposed that perceiving the flow of the CSF they are involved in 
      vasoregulatory mechanisms of the nervous tissue. In the present work, we examined 
      the brain ventricular system of the Atlantic hagfish with special reference to the 
      presence and fine structure of CSF-contacting neurons. Myxinoids have an 
      ontogenetically reduced brain ventricular system. In the adult hagfish (Myxine 
      glutinosa) the lumen of the lateral ventricle is closed, the third ventricle has a 
      preoptic-, infundibular and subhabenular part that are not connected to each other. 
      The choroid plexus is absent. The infundibular part of the third ventricle has a 
      medial hypophyseal recess and, more caudally, a paired lateral recess. We found 
      CSF-contacting neurons in the lower part of the third ventricle, in the preoptic and 
      infundibular recess as well as in the lateral infundibular recesses. No 
      CSF-contacting neurons were found in the cerebral aqueduct connecting the 
      subhabenular recess to the fourth ventricle. There is a pineal recess and a 
      well-developed subcommissural organ at the rostral end of the aqueduct. Extending 
      from the caudal part of the fourth ventricle in the medulla to the caudal end of the 
      spinal cord, the central canal has a dorsal and ventral part. Dendrites of 
      CSF-contacting neurons are protruding into the ventral lumen. Corroborating the 
      supposed choroid plexus-like function of the wall of the dorsal central canal, 
      segmental vessels reach a thin area on both sides of the ependymal lining. The 
      perikarya of the CSF-contacting neurons found in the brain ventricles are mainly 
      bipolar and contain granular vesicles of various size. The bulb-like terminal of 
      their ventricular dendrites bears several stereocilia and contains basal bodies as 
      well as mitochondria. Basal bodies emit cilia of the 9+0-type. Cilia may arise from 
      the basal body and accessory basal body as well. The axons run ependymofugally and 
      enter--partially cross--the periventricular synaptic zones. No neurohemal terminals 
      similar to those formed by spinal CSF-contacting neurons of higher vertebrates have 
      been found in the hagfish. We suppose that CSF-contacting neurons transform 
      CSF-mediated non-synaptic information taken up by their ventricular dendrites to 
      synaptic one. A light-sensitive role for some (preoptic?) groups of CSF-contacting 
      neurons cannot be excluded.

TI  - Evolution of myelin sheaths: both lamprey and hagfish lack myelin.
PG  - 145-8
AB  - Modern views of agnathan phylogeny consider Petromyzoniformes and Myxiniformes to 
      belong to distinct classes that diverged from a common ancestor at a remote period, 
      perhaps in the lower Cambrian, greater than 600 million years ago. Both are more 
      primitive than elasmobranchs, holocephalans and bony fishes. Myelin is well 
      developed in elasmobranchs and other fishes but was reported to be lacking in the 
      spinal cord of lampreys. In order to search further for possible early myelin in 
      some part of the nervous system of one of the agnathan stems, or for further 
      evidence that it first appeared in chondrichthians, we extended the sampling to many 
      parts of the brain and cord of hagfish. Transmission electron microscopy was used as 
      a nearly ideal criterion. We find no trace or forerunner of the spiral, 
      multilaminate glial wrapping. Many axons are embedded within one or more glial 
      cells, like unmyelinated fibers in other vertebrates, or lie contiguously in bundles 
      without an obviously complete glial investment. True myelin must be presumed to have 
      been invented within the vertebrates, in ancestors of the living cartilaginous 
      fishes after the agnathans branched from the vertebrate stem.

      Eptatretus stouti, and the lamprey, Petromyzon marinus.
PG  - 489-99
AB  - Acid extracts of the brain of the pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stouti, and the marine 
      lamprey, Petromyzon marinus, were each fractionated by gel filtration chromatography 
      and aliquots of column fractions were screened with radioimmunoassays (RIAs) 
      specific for pro-dynorphin-related end products and for pro-enkephalin-related end 
      products. Only pro-enkephalin-related immunoreactive forms were detected. The 
      enkephalin-sized immunoreactive material, isolated for each species, was separately 
      fractionated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). 
      Aliquots of column fractions were screened with RIAs specific for Met-enkephalin, 
      Leu-enkephalin, Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe, and Met-enkephalin-Arg-Gly-Leu. In the 
      hagfish brain, immunoreactive forms with the same retention times as synthetic 
      Met-enkephalin and Leu-enkephalin were detected in a ratio of approximately 2:1. In 
      addition, an immunoreactive form was detected with the 
      Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe-specific RIA. This form had the same chromatographic 
      properties as synthetic Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe. Analyses with the 
      Met-enkephalin-Arg-Gly-Leu RIA were negative. HPLC analysis of the lamprey 
      enkephalin-related material revealed the presence of authentic Met-enkaphalin and 
      Leu-enkephalin in a molar ratio of 3:1. C-terminally extended forms of 
      Met-enkaphalin were not detected in the lamprey extracts. Collectively these 
      observations indicate that pro-enkephalin-related opioid peptides are present in the 
      brain of cyclostomes.

TI  - Characterization of immunoglobulin from the Pacific hagfish, a primitive vertebrate.
PG  - 5679-82
AB  - Antibodies to group A streptococcal carbohydrate, demonstrable by radioimmunoassay, 
      were elicited in Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii, after prolonged immunization 
      with whole cell vaccine. This hagfish antibody, isolated by ion-exchange 
      chromatography of immune serum, exhibited a single precipitin line after 
      immunoelectrophoresis against rabbit antiserum to hagfish serum. The isolated 
      antibodies retained high binding activity for the streptococcal carbohydrate, but 
      lacked the natural hemagglutinating activity found in both nonimmune and immune 
      sera. Analysis by gel filtration in neutral and dissociating buffers and by sodium 
      dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions 
      indicated an intact molecule of molecular weight approximately 160,000 that may be 
      noncovalently associated in a polymer of higher molecular weight. Heavy chains of 
      mobility identical to that of murine mu chains and light chains of mobility 
      significantly slower than murine lambda chains were obtained after sodium dodecyl 
      sulfate gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Instability of the tertiary 
      structure of the antibody molecule was indicated by partial dissociation in buffers 
      containing sodium dodecyl sulfate and by dissociation at low concentrations of 
      reducing agent. In contrast to its well-developed system of cell-mediated immunity, 
      only a minimal system of circulating antibody production is evident in this 
      primitive fish. No evidence for divergence of cyclostome lymphocytes into separate 
      T- and B-cell systems has yet been discerned.

TI  - Distribution of gonadotropin-releasing hormone immunoreactivity in the brain of the 
      Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stouti (Craniata: Myxinoidea).
PG  - 464-76
AB  - The distribution of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-like immunoreactivity in 
      the brain of a myxinoid, the Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stouti), was investigated 
      via immunohistochemistry, including the use of six different antisera. In the 
      diencephalon, immunoreactive cell bodies were found in two systems: the infundibular 
      hypothalamus, a neuromodulatory nucleus with diffuse projections of varicose fibers 
      to most areas of the brain, and a primarily preoptic system of putatively 
      hypophysiotropic neurons that projects to the neurohypophysis. Some potential 
      neurovascular and CSF contacts were also identified. These findings are consistent 
      with those of similar studies in other craniates and suggest that a preoptic 
      hypophysiotropic system may be present in all craniates. We therefore tentatively 
      accept the homology of this system in hagfish and vertebrates. The homology of the 
      distributed hypothalamic system is more dubious. It may be homologous to a caudal 
      GnRH system of modulatory neurons found in many vertebrates. Antiserum PBL-49 
      displays a differential affinity for the two systems, indicating that the two 
      systems differ in the amount or identity of the immunoreactive substance. We suggest 
      that the two systems have distinct functions in hagfish. The primitive function of 
      GnRH-like molecules in craniates may have thus been both neuromodulatory and 
      hypophysiotropic. These findings also indicate that the brain-pituitary axis of 
      hagfish is more similar to that of vertebrates than has been previously suggested.

TI  - Developmental biology of hagfishes, with a report on newly obtained embryos of the 
      Japanese inshore hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri.
PG  - 999-1011
LID - 10.2108/zsj.25.999 [doi]
AB  - The apparently primitive features of hagfishes are recognized as a crucial problem 
      in the study of vertebrate evolution, although the monophyletic relationship between 
      these animals and lampreys has been confirmed by large amounts of molecular data, 
      including genome and EST sequences. To solve this problem requires knowledge of the 
      developmental biology of hagfishes. We attempted to obtain embryos from the Japanese 
      inshore hagfish ( Eptatretus burgeri ) and succeeded in preparing several nicely 
      fixed embryos. Based on detailed histological observations and comparison of gene 
      expression patterns with those of conventional vertebrates, we examined the 
      developmental processes involved in some important morphological traits, including 
      the neural crest, placode, pharyngeal arches, and others. Our data revealed that 
      some apparently primitive morphological traits can be regarded as artifacts deriving 
      mainly from fixation conditions. In addition, our long-term observations of live 
      embryos revealed a slow developmental rate in this animal. In this review, we 
      summarize recent developmental data from these hagfish embryos and discuss a 
      plausible evolutionary scenario for vertebrate development, making comparisons with 
      some old descriptions.

TI  - [The brain of the Agnatha].
PG  - 436-47
AB  - The brain of the Agnatha, especially of the hagfish, is discussed from the viewpoint 
      of the telencephalon and the olfactory, visual, trigeminal, and vestibulolateral 
      sensory systems. Myxiniformes and Petromyzontiformes, which were an independent 
      group in the Ordovician, are thought to represent some parallels of ancestral 
      vertebrate brains. It is interesting to study the brain of the Agnatha to 
      investigate the process of the evolution of the vertebrate brain. In comparison with 
      the lamprey, the hagfish has subcutaneous eyes under an unpigmented patch of skin, 4 
      paired tentacles at the rostral tip of the head, one semicircular canal on each 
      side, a regressed ventricular system, a "primordium hippocampi" of unresolved 
      homology in the telencephalon, no pineal body, fusion of the habenula of both sides, 
      a tectum opticum with unclear laminations, no macroscopical cerebellum, and optic 
      decussation within the hypothalamus. The arrangements of the trigeminal subnuclei of 
      the descending tract are different from each other, unlike those of other 
      gnathosomata. In the hagfish, the distribution of fibers carrying input of the 
      vestibulum and lateral line system within the area vestibulo-lateralis differs from 
      that of the lamprey, which resembles the teleosts and cartilaginous fish in this 
      respect. These differences may be caused by an independent origin within the 
      Agnatha. The basic organization of the brain of the Agnatha, such as the 
      prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon are common to the gnathostomata, 
      although some variations in development are included in the sensory centers and 
      higher centers of information processing. The sensory neurons within the brain are 
      found in the medulla oblongata in the Agnatha, whereas in the gnathostomata the 
      mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve has been formed in connection with the 
      development of the mandibula.

TI  - Evolutionary origin and divergence of GnIH and its homologous peptides.
PG  - 30-3
LID - 10.1016/j.ygcen.2008.10.002 [doi]
AB  - Probing undiscovered hypothalamic neuropeptides that play important roles in the 
      regulation of pituitary function in vertebrates is essential for the progress of 
      neuroendocrinology. In 2000, we discovered a novel hypothalamic dodecapeptide 
      inhibiting gonadotropin release in quail and termed it gonadotropin-inhibitory 
      hormone (GnIH). GnIH acts on the pituitary and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) 
      neurons in the hypothalamus via a novel G protein-coupled receptor for GnIH to 
      inhibit gonadal development and maintenance by decreasing gonadotropin release and 
      synthesis. Similar findings were observed in other avian species. Thus, GnIH is a 
      key factor controlling avian reproduction. To give our findings a broader 
      perspective, we also found GnIH homologous peptides in the hypothalamus of other 
      vertebrates, such as mammals, reptiles, amphibians and teleosts. GnIH and its 
      homologs share a common C-terminal LPXRFamide (X=L or Q) motif. A mammalian GnIH 
      homolog also inhibited gonadotropin release in mammals like the GnIH action in 
      birds. In contrast to higher vertebrates, hypophysiotropic activities of GnIH 
      homologs were different in lower vertebrates. To clarify the evolutionary origin of 
      GnIH and its homologs, we further sought to identify novel LPXRFamide peptides from 
      the brain of sea lamprey and hagfish, two extant groups of the oldest lineage of 
      vertebrates, Agnatha. In these agnathans, LPXRFamide peptide and its cDNA were 
      identified only from the brain of hagfish. Based on these findings over the past 
      decade, this paper summarizes the evolutionary origin and divergence of GnIH and its 
      homologous peptides.

TI  - Bicarbonate binding to hemoglobin links oxygen and carbon dioxide transport in 
      hagfish.
PG  - 309-15
AB  - Hagfish are unusual among vertebrates in having red cells that almost completely 
      lack the anion-exchanger membrane protein band III and hemoglobins that are highly 
      sensitive to CO2 but only weakly affected by protons. This suggests a different 
      linkage between oxygen and CO2 transport from that of the majority of vertebrates, 
      which is characterized by oxygen-linked proton binding to hemoglobin and 
      chloride-bicarbonate exchange across band III protein. We here report that the 
      hemoglobin of the hagfish Myxtne glutinosa shows oxygen-linked binding of 
      bicarbonate, which decreases the oxygen affinity and thereby enhances oxygen 
      unloading to the tissues. Bicarbonate binding to the hemoglobin moreover facilitates 
      the hydration of CO2 and its transport as intraerythrocytic bicarbonate, and may 
      compensate at least in part for the virtual absence of band III protein. This 
      represents a unique linkage between oxygen and CO2 transport among vertebrates, 
      where the physiological role of protons in the Bohr and Haldane effects is played by 
      bicarbonate ions.

TI  - An ancient prevertebrate Na+-nucleoside cotransporter (hfCNT) from the Pacific 
      hagfish (Eptatretus stouti).
PG  - C155-68
AB  - The human concentrative (Na+-linked) plasma membrane transport proteins hCNT1, 
      hCNT2, and hCNT3 are pyrimidine nucleoside-selective (system cit), purine 
      nucleoside-selective (system cif), or broadly selective for both pyrimidine and 
      purine nucleosides (system cib), respectively. All have orthologs in other mammalian 
      species and belong to a gene family (CNT) that has members in insects, nematodes, 
      pathogenic yeast, and bacteria. Here, we report the cDNA cloning and functional 
      characterization of a CNT family member from an ancient marine prevertebrate, the 
      Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stouti). This Na+-nucleoside symporter, designated 
      hfCNT, is the first transport protein to be characterized in detail in hagfish and 
      is a 683-amino acid residue protein with 13 predicted transmembrane helical segments 
      (TMs). hfCNT was 52, 50, and 57% identical in sequence to hCNT1, hCNT2, and hCNT3, 
      respectively. Similarity to hCNT3 was particularly marked in the TM 4-13 region. 
      When produced in Xenopus oocytes, hfCNT exhibited the transport properties of system 
      cib, with uridine, thymidine, and inosine apparent K(m) values of 10-45 microM. The 
      antiviral nucleoside drugs 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine, 2',3'-dideoxycytidine, and 
      2',3'-dideoxyinosine were also transported. Simultaneous measurement of 
      uridine-evoked currents and radiolabeled uridine uptake under voltage-clamp 
      conditions gave a Na+-to-uridine coupling ratio of 2:1 (cf. 2:1 for hCNT3 and 1:1 
      for hCNT1/2). The apparent K50 value for Na+ activation was >100 mM. A 50:50 chimera 
      between hfCNT and hCNT1 (TMs 7-13 of hfCNT replaced by those of hCNT1) exhibited 
      hCNT1-like cation interactions, establishing that the structural determinants of 
      cation stoichiometry and binding affinity were located within the carboxy-terminal 
      half of the protein. The high degree of sequence similarity between hfCNT and hCNT3 
      may indicate functional constraints on the primary structure of the transporter and 
      suggests that cib-type CNTs fulfill important physiological functions.

LID - 20170765
AB  - Hagfishes defend themselves from fish predators by releasing large volumes of 
      gill-clogging slime when they are attacked. Slime release is not anticipatory, but 
      is only released after an attack has been initiated, raising the question of how 
      hagfishes survive the initial attack, especially from biting predators such as 
      sharks. We tested two hypotheses that could explain how hagfishes avoid damage from 
      shark bites: puncture-resistant skin, and a loose and flaccid body design that makes 
      it difficult for teeth to penetrate body musculature and viscera. Based on data from 
      skin puncture tests from 22 fish species, we found that hagfish skin is not 
      remarkably puncture resistant. Simulated shark bites on hagfish and their closest 
      living relatives, lamprey, as well as whole animal inflation tests, revealed that 
      the loose attachment of hagfish skin to the rest of the body and the substantial 
      'slack volume' in the subcutaneous sinus protect hagfish musculature and viscera 
      from penetrating teeth. While recent work has found evidence that the capacious 
      subcutaneous sinus in hagfishes is important for behaviours such as knot-tying and 
      burrowing, our work demonstrates that it also plays a role in predator defence.

TI  - Ontogeny of the head of the Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stouti, Myxinoidea): 
      development of the lateral line system.
PG  - 119-34
AB  - The head of adult hagfishes (jawless craniates, Myxinoidea) of the family 
      Eptatretidae displays a number of skin grooves of uncertain origin. These grooves 
      have been homologized to the neuromast lines of other craniates, and they are 
      innervated by two ganglionated cranial nerves that have been interpreted as lateral 
      line nerves. The grooves do not, however, contain the compound receptors that are 
      typical of a lateral line (i.e. neuromasts or electroreceptors), and both their 
      development and function have remained enigmatic. To elucidate the embryonic origin 
      of the grooves (which should develop from placodes if they are homologues of the 
      lateral line system), embryos of Pacific hagfish were examined by means of 
      three-dimensional reconstructions from serial sections. Because of the scarcity of 
      specimens of embryonic hagfishes, only two embryos were reconstructed, but these 
      reconstructions clearly show that a number of placodes and placodal derivatives 
      (i.e. sensory ridges, receptor primordia, and cranial ganglia) occur in the head of 
      embryonic eptatretid hagfishes. Some of these placodes correspond to the lens and 
      epibranchial placodes of other craniates, but there are also three other placodes 
      which represent possible homologues of lateral line placodes. The topology of the 
      placodes in this latter group corresponds to the topology of the grooves of adult 
      hagfishes, and we therefore reach three conclusions: (i) that an embryonic lateral 
      line system is present in hagfishes; (ii) that the grooves of adult hagfishes in all 
      probability derive from lateral line placodes; and (iii) that the presence of 
      lateral line placodes is a primitive character of craniates.

      section and freeze-fracture study.
PG  - 201-13
AB  - The fine structure of the kidney (glomerulus and archinephric duct) of the hagfish. 
      Myxine glutinosa (L.) was studied in thin sections and by freeze-fracture technique. 
      The glomerular filtration barrier is similar to that of mammalian kidneys. However, 
      endothelial fenestrations are relatively scanty and the basement membranes of 
      endothelial cells and podocytes always appear separated by a layer of collagen 
      fibrils and microfibrils often surrounding numerous and extended mesangial cells. 
      Between podocytes and their processes maculae occludentes and peculiar junctions of 
      another type occur. The zonulae occludentes between epithelial cells of the 
      archinephric duct are composed of five or more strands, occasionally of only one or 
      two.

TI  - Biochemical and molecular characterization of acetylcholinesterase from the hagfish 
      Myxine glutinosa.
PG  - 97-109
AB  - To obtain information about the evolution of the cholinesterases, we investigated 
      the cholinesterase activity of an agnathan vertebrate, the hagfish Myxine glutinosa. 
      On the basis of evidence from enzymology, pharmacology, and molecular biology, we 
      conclude that the cholinesterase activity is due to acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The 
      enzyme hydrolyzes acetylthiocholine preferentially and exhibits substrate 
      inhibition. The hydrolysis of both acetylthiocholine and butyrylthiocholine are 
      inhibited in parallel by cholinesterase inhibitors, with the AChE-specific drug 
      BW284c51 being the most potent; however, this drug and propidium, a peripheral 
      anionic site ligand, are much weaker inhibitors of the hagfish enzyme than of 
      Torpedo AChE. We used sequential extraction, collagenase digestion, and velocity 
      sedimentation on sucrose gradients to determine that the AChE from the skeletal 
      muscle of the hagfish is present in both globular and asymmetric forms. We also used 
      the polymerase chain reaction with degenerate oligonucleotide probes and genomic DNA 
      to obtain a 1 kb gene fragment for hagfish AChE. The enzyme has an acyl binding site 
      typical of other vertebrate AChE, but lacks two aromatic residues implicated in the 
      function of the peripheral anionic subsite. We discuss the relevance of our findings 
      to the evolution of the cholinesterases in the vertebrates.

TI  - Variable domains in hagfish: NICIR is a polymorphic multigene family expressed 
      preferentially in leukocytes and is related to lamprey TCR-like.
PG  - 216-25
AB  - The jawless vertebrates, represented by hagfish and lampreys, are the most advanced 
      animals that apparently lack T cell and B cell receptors. As such, they offer unique 
      opportunities for understanding the evolution of antigen receptors and variable 
      (V)-type immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains. In the present study, we describe four 
      hagfish Ig superfamily (IgSF) members carrying V-type domains. None of them appeared 
      to have direct counterparts in jawed vertebrates, indicating that many IgSF 
      molecules have either evolved independently in jawed and jawless vertebrates or 
      diverged to the extent that clear homology is no longer recognizable. One of the 
      members encoded a molecule closely related to the previously described membrane 
      protein designated novel ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation 
      motif)-containing IgSF receptors (NICIR). We show here that NICIR is a polymorphic 
      multigene family with at least three members and is expressed predominantly in 
      peripheral blood leukocytes. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that among known 
      proteins, NICIR is most closely related to the lamprey molecule recently proposed to 
      be a potential ancestor of T cell receptors.

TI  - Organization of the trigeminal and facial motor nuclei in the hagfish, Eptatretus 
      burgeri: a retrograde HRP study.
PG  - 263-72
AB  - We studied the trigeminal and facial motor nuclei of the hagfish by the retrograde 
      HRP method. We distinguished 4 components in a single column of the motor nuclei of 
      the trigeminal nerve and the facial nerve, viz., the pars magnocellularis of the 
      trigeminal motor nucleus (mVm), the anterior part of the pars parvocellularis of the 
      trigeminal motor nucleus (mVp1), the posterior part of the pars parvocellularis of 
      the trigeminal motor nucleus (mVp2) and the facial motor nucleus (mVII). Although in 
      Nissl preparations only the mVm could be distinguished from the rest of the nucleus, 
      the boundaries of the other 3 components were clearly demarcated in HRP 
      preparations. Intramuscular injections into two representative antagonistic jaw 
      muscles revealed that there was no apparent topological organization of the neurons 
      pertaining to the opening and closing muscles in the mVm and mVp1, but both 
      antagonistic muscles were innervated bilaterally. Although the hagfish does possess 
      a cartilaginous jaw, the organization pattern of the motor nuclei of the jaw muscles 
      seems to be the most primitive of all living vertebrates.

TI  - Analysis of lamprey and hagfish genes reveals a complex history of gene duplications 
      during early vertebrate evolution.
PG  - 1440-50
AB  - It has been proposed that two events of duplication of the entire genome occurred 
      early in vertebrate history (2R hypothesis). Several phylogenetic studies with a few 
      gene families (mostly Hox genes and proteins from the MHC) have tried to confirm 
      these polyploidization events. However, data from a single locus cannot explain the 
      evolutionary history of a complete genome. To study this 2R hypothesis, we have 
      taken advantage of the phylogenetic position of the lamprey to study the history of 
      gene duplications in vertebrates. We selected most gene families that contain 
      several paralogous genes in vertebrates and for which lamprey genes and an out-group 
      are known in databases. In addition, we isolated members of the nuclear receptor 
      superfamily in lamprey. Hagfish genes were also analyzed and found to confirm the 
      lamprey gene analysis. Consistent with the 2R hypothesis, the phylogenetic analysis 
      of 33 selected gene families, dispersed through the whole genome, revealed that one 
      period of gene duplication arose before the lamprey-gnathostome split and this was 
      followed by a second period of gene duplication after the lamprey-gnathostome split. 
      Nevertheless, our analysis suggests that numerous gene losses and other gene-genome 
      duplications occurred during the evolution of the vertebrate genomes. Thus, the 
      complexity of all the paralogy groups present in vertebrates should be explained by 
      the contribution of genome duplications (2R hypothesis), extra gene duplications, 
      and gene losses.

PG  - 169-80
AB  - The central projections of primary trigeminal afferents in Pacific hagfish 
      (Eptatretus stouti) were examined by transganglionic transport of horseradish 
      peroxidase (HRP) placed in the principal nerves of the trigeminal complex. Central 
      to the trigeminal ganglia, labeled afferents in the ophthalmic, external and dental 
      nerves coursed caudally in the descending trigeminal tract of the ipsilateral 
      medulla. The trigeminal tract occupies an extensive portion of the dorsolateral 
      medulla and is subdivided into a consistent pattern of longitudinal fascicles 
      surrounded by narrow cellular bands. Primary trigeminal afferents were arranged 
      somatotopically in the fascicles. Large-diameter afferents of the ophthalmic, 
      external and dental nerves segregated into separate medial fascicles extending from 
      the dorsomedial to the ventrolateral descending trigeminal tract. Fine-fibered 
      afferents of the ophthalmic and external nerves formed separate dorsolateral 
      fascicles. Additional dental afferents spread through these lateral fascicles. 
      Labeled trigeminal fibers reached the dorsolateral funiculus of the rostral spinal 
      cord. In addition, HRP injections of the descending trigeminal tract revealed a 
      largely crossed projection to the mesencephalic tectum. Tectal injections of HRP 
      retrogradely labeled neurons in the contralateral sensory trigeminal tract, 
      confirming the existence of a tract nucleus comprised in part of neurons located in 
      the bands of cells bordering the primary afferent fascicles.

TI  - The mechanical properties of hydrated intermediate filaments: insights from hagfish 
      slime threads.
PG  - 2015-27
AB  - Intermediate filaments (IFs) impart mechanical integrity to cells, yet IF mechanics 
      are poorly understood. It is assumed that IFs in cells are as stiff as hard 
      alpha-keratin, F-actin, and microtubules, but the high bending flexibility of IFs 
      and the low stiffness of soft alpha-keratins suggest that hydrated IFs may be quite 
      soft. To test this hypothesis, we measured the tensile mechanics of the keratin-like 
      threads from hagfish slime, which are an ideal model for exploring the mechanics of 
      IF bundles and IFs because they consist of tightly packed and aligned IFs. Tensile 
      tests suggest that hydrated IF bundles possess low initial stiffness (E(i) = 6.4 
      MPa) and remarkable elasticity (up to strains of 0.34), which we attribute to soft 
      elastomeric IF protein terminal domains in series with stiffer coiled coils. The 
      high tensile strength (180 MPa) and toughness (130 MJ/m(3)) of IF bundles support 
      the notion that IFs lend mechanical integrity to cells. Their long-range elasticity 
      suggests that IFs may also allow cells to recover from large deformations. X-ray 
      diffraction and congo-red staining indicate that post-yield deformation leads to an 
      irreversible alpha-->beta conformational transition in IFs, which leads to plastic 
      deformation, and may be used by cells as a mechanosensory cue.

TI  - Hagfish insulin: the discrepancy between binding affinity and biologic activity.
PG  - 301-3
AB  - Hagfish insulin exhibits a binding affinity of about 25% of that of pig insulin in 
      rat adipocytes and IM-9 lymphocytes, even though its relative biologic potency is 
      only about 5% in adipocytes. The dissociation rate constant of hagfish insulin is 
      about half that of pig insulin, and the association rate constant is about one 
      eighth. A longer time is, therefore, required for hagfish insulin to reach a steady 
      state of binding. Failure to reach steady state is the probable reason why some 
      previous results suggested a relative binding affinity of hagfish insulin of the 
      same magnitude as the relative biologic potency.

TI  - Water regulates oxygen binding in hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) hemoglobin.
PG  - 1389-95
AB  - Hagfish hemoglobin (Hb) is considered to represent a transition stage between 
      invertebrate and vertebrate hemoglobins. The Hb system of Myxine glutinosa consists 
      of three monomeric hemoglobins, which upon deoxygenation associate to form primarily 
      heterodimers and heterotetramers. Myxine glutinosa is an osmoconformer, whose red 
      blood cells show the exceptional ability to swell and remain swollen under 
      hyposmotic conditions. In order to determine whether water activity regulates 
      hemoglobin function, the effect of changes in osmolality on hemoglobin-O(2) affinity 
      was investigated by applying the osmotic stress method to purified hemoglobins as 
      well as intact red blood cells. Oxygen affinity decreases when water activity 
      increases, indicating that water molecules stabilize the low-affinity, oligomeric 
      state of the hemoglobin. This effect is opposite to that observed in tetrameric 
      vertebrate hemoglobins, but resembles that seen in the dimeric hemoglobin of the 
      marine clam Scapharca inaequivalvis. Our data show that water may act as an 
      allosteric effector for hemoglobin within intact red cells and even in animals that 
      do not experience large variations in blood osmolality.

TI  - A single and novel natriuretic peptide is expressed in the heart and brain of the 
      most primitive vertebrate, the hagfish (Eptatretus burgeri).
PG  - 209-20
AB  - In teleost fish and tetrapods, the natriuretic peptide (NP) family consists of ANP 
      (atrial natriuretic peptide), BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) and VNP (ventricular 
      natriuretic peptide) that are secreted from the heart, and C-type natriuretic 
      peptide (CNP) that is found in the brain. However, CNP is the only NP identified in 
      the heart and brain of elasmobranchs, suggesting that it is the ancestral type of 
      the NP family and that ANP, BNP and VNP appeared later in the vertebrate phylogeny. 
      To delineate more clearly the molecular evolution of this hormone family, we 
      determined the sequence of NP molecule(s) in evolutionarily the oldest vertebrate 
      group, the cyclostomes. We have cloned a novel NP cDNA from the heart and brain of 
      hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri, using the RACE method and degenerate primers that 
      amplify all known types of NP cDNAs. The novel NP, named EbuNP after the scientific 
      name of this hagfish, appears to be the only NP in the heart and brain, as no other 
      NP cDNAs were amplified even after specific removal of the cloned EbuNP mRNA from 
      the mRNA pool, except for a minor alternatively spliced EbuNP cDNA with a truncated 
      3'-untranslated sequence. The EbuNP was equally similar to known NPs but was not 
      considered to be a CNP because of the presence of a C-terminal tail sequence. The 
      EbuNP gene was abundantly expressed in the cardiac atrium, ventricle, portal heart 
      and brain but scarcely in the intestine; no expression was observed in the gill and 
      kidney. Mass spectrometry of affinity-purified EbuNP in plasma, heart and brain 
      revealed a 68 amino acid peptide circulating in the blood and stored in the heart, 
      which is cleaved at the typical cleavage signal of a processing enzyme, furin, as 
      observed in mammalian BNP. The C-terminal Gly residue was used for amidation as is 
      the case in eel ANP. The immunoreactive EbuNP was not detected in the brain, 
      suggesting the presence of a different processing form in the brain. These results 
      show that the molecular evolution of the NP family in vertebrates is more complex 
      than previously thought.

TI  - An immunocytochemical investigation of glial morphology in the Pacific hagfish: 
      radial and astrocyte-like glia have the same phylogenetic age.
PG  - 565-76
AB  - This study attempts to reconstruct the early phylogenetic history of macroglial 
      cells among craniates. Since glia does not fossilize, such a reconstruction must be 
      based on a cladistic comparison of glial characters in the Recent craniate taxa 
      (hagfishes, lampreys, and gnathostomes); however, there are only few data on glial 
      morphology and none on glial immunocytochemistry in hagfishes. Therefore, we 
      investigated the presence and localization of various macroglia-specific epitopes in 
      the brain and spinal cord of the Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stouti (Myxinoidea) by 
      means of immunocytochemistry. Antibodies directed against S100-protein and vimentin 
      showed no cross reactivity. Antibodies directed against glial fibrillary acidic 
      protein and glutamine synthetase labelled various glial structures. Glial fibrillary 
      acidic protein-like immunoreactivity was observed in ependymal cells with radially 
      oriented processes in some regions. However, throughout the entire CNS, labelling of 
      non-ependymal cells and their processes prevailed. The processes of these cells made 
      occasional vascular contacts and they also made contacts with neuronal perikarya. 
      Glutamine synthetase-like immunoreactivity was also found in some processes with 
      radial orientation and in ependymal cells; but the antibody stained mainly 
      non-ependymal cells which gave rise to a felt-like meshwork of interdigitating fine 
      and very fine processes penetrating the neuropil of the entire brain. Additionally, 
      there was labelling in the walls of blood vessels and in processes enwrapping 
      individual neurons. The occurrence of glial fibrillary acidic protein- and glutamine 
      synthetase-like immunoreactivity in non-ependymal glial elements in the brain of 
      hagfishes and the relative scarcity of labelling in radial glial elements 
      necessitates a re-interpretation of the evolutionary history of glial cells. 
      Non-ependymal macroglia with immunocytochemical and morphological characters 
      resembling typical (mammalian) astrocytes appears to be as primitive as the various 
      forms of radial ependymal glia.

TI  - Evolution of variable lymphocyte receptor B antibody loci in jawless vertebrates.
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2116522118 [doi]
LID - e2116522118
AB  - Three types of variable lymphocyte receptor (VLR) genes, VLRA, VLRB, and VLRC, 
      encode antigen recognition receptors in the extant jawless vertebrates, lampreys and 
      hagfish. The somatically diversified repertoires of these VLRs are generated by 
      serial stepwise copying of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) sequences into an incomplete 
      germline VLR gene. Lymphocytes that express VLRA or VLRC are T cell-like, while 
      VLRB-expressing cells are B cell-like. Here, we analyze the composition of the VLRB 
      locus in different jawless vertebrates to elucidate its configuration and 
      evolutionary modification. The incomplete germline VLRB genes of two hagfish species 
      contain short noncoding intervening sequences, whereas germline VLRB genes in six 
      representative lamprey species have much longer intervening sequences that exhibit 
      notable genomic variation. Genomic clusters of potential LRR cassette donors, 
      fragments of which are copied to complete VLRB gene assembly, are identified in 
      Japanese lamprey and sea lamprey. In the sea lamprey, 428 LRR cassettes are located 
      in five clusters spread over a total of 1.7 Mbp of chromosomal DNA. Preferential 
      usage of the different donor cassettes for VLRB assemblage is characterized in our 
      analysis, which reveals evolutionary modifications of the lamprey VLRB genes, 
      elucidates the organization of the complex VLRB locus, and provides a comprehensive 
      catalog of donor VLRB cassettes in sea lamprey and Japanese lamprey.

TI  - Freshwater or marine origin of the vertebrates?
PG  - 523-31
AB  - 1. Paleontological data indicate that the earliest recognizable vertebrate remains, 
      bone fragments of Upper Cambrian and Lower Ordovician heterostracan fishes, were 
      deposited in a marine situation. 2. Since these earliest fossils are sporadic in 
      occurrence, from atypical marine deposits and since they only represent the full 
      grown adult stage, the possibility of a freshwater developmental stage or estuarine 
      habitat cannot be excluded. 3. The hagfishes, supposedly the most primitive of 
      living vertebrates, are exclusively marine and possess an osmoregulatory strategy 
      (monovalent ion levels nearly identical with sea-water with little capability of 
      regulation) that is consonant with a strictly marine evolutionary history. Possibly, 
      but less parsimoniously, this strategy and habitat could be secondarily derived. 4. 
      The hagfish has a glomerular kidney, renal sodium reabsorption and branchial pumps 
      for the uptake of sodium and chloride which are indicative, but not unequivocally 
      diagnostic, of a freshwater ancestry. 5. A scenario in which the earliest vertebrate 
      was anadromous, breeding in fresh water and migrating to the sea, is consistent with 
      the paleontological data and with the physiology and life history of living 
      'primitive' fishes. It also leads to more coherent explanations for the origin of 
      bone and for the evolution of vertebrate special senses than do alternative marine 
      scenarios.

TI  - Keratin-like components of gland thread cells modulate the properties of mucus from 
      hagfish (Eptatretus stouti).
PG  - 79-86
AB  - The hagfishes (cyclostomes) are known to secrete copious amounts of mucus mainly by 
      the holocrine mode from the slime glands. Stressed animals release two types of 
      cells (gland thread cells, GTCs; gland mucous cells. GMCs) which rupture on contact 
      with water and rapidly form a mass of viscous mucus. Herein we report some key 
      sequential events of this process and document a novel role for cytoskeletal 
      polymers. After electrostimulation of Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stouti), the 
      exudate was collected in a stabilization buffer and GTCs segregated from GMC 
      vesicles. Water was added progressively to mixtures of known quantities of these 
      entities. The changing mucous composition and properties were monitored by light- 
      and electron microscopy, viscometry and immunogold assay. Sequentially, the threads 
      uncoil from GTCs, aggregate with the vesicles, the vesicles rupture and release 
      mucin-like substances, at least some of which adhere to the thread. It was found 
      that the intermediate filament (IF)-rich threads markedly facilitate hydration and 
      modulate the viscoelastic and cohesive properties of the resultant mucus. It was 
      speculated that the thread abets localization of mucus in an aqueous environment and 
      promotes adhesion of mucus to surfaces such as the fish integument. As judged by 
      immunostaining in situ, GTCs, as well as several cell-types in the epidermis, 
      contain keratin-like components. The role of biopolymers on the properties of 
      teleost and mammalian mucus is discussed.

TI  - Immunological detection of Na(+)/H(+) exchangers in the gills of a hagfish, Myxine 
      glutinosa, an elasmobranch, Raja erinacea, and a teleost, Fundulus heteroclitus.
PG  - 375-85
AB  - Na(+)/H(+) exchangers (NHE) are a family of ion exchangers with diverse functions 
      that are well defined in mammals. NHE-1 is expressed in the plasma membrane of most 
      mammalian cells where it regulates intracellular pH, and usually in the basolateral 
      membrane of epithelial cells. It has also been detected in teleost gills where it 
      may participate in systemic pH regulation. NHE-3 is usually expressed in the apical 
      membrane of mammalian epithelial cells where it helps reabsorb Na(+) and HCO(3)(-); 
      it has also been detected in teleost gills. We used Western blotting and 
      heterologous antibodies to screen for expression of NHE-1 and NHE-3 in gills of an 
      agnathan (Myxine glutinosa) and an elasmobranch (Raja erinacea), and NHE-3 in gills 
      of a teleost (Fundulus heteroclitus). Positive NHE-1 bands were detected in gills 
      from the agnathan and elasmobranch. Using the NHE-3 antibody, bands were detected in 
      the gills of the elasmobranch and teleost. These data are some of the first direct 
      evidence of NHEs in the gills of an agnathan and elasmobranch, and confirm the 
      presence of NHEs in the gills of teleosts.

TI  - Somatotopic organization of the primary sensory trigeminal neurons in the hagfish, 
      Eptatretus burgeri.
PG  - 281-95
AB  - Primary sensory trigeminal projections were investigated in the hagfish following 
      application of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to the sensory branches. In our control 
      preparations we were able to distinguish five sensory ganglia and their respective 
      nerves. HRP application confirmed the almost exclusive relation of each of these 
      nerves to their respective ganglia, with very little overlap. In normal frontal 
      sections of the medulla oblongata, five columns of fibers surrounded by neuronal 
      cell bodies could be clearly distinguished, but the number is probably fortuitous, 
      for there was no one-on-one relationship with the five trigeminal ganglia. From 
      their peripheral connections, we surmised that columns 1 and 3 handle general 
      cutaneous sensation, columns 2, 4, and 5 handle taste sensation, and column 5 
      handles general mucous cutaneous sensation conveyed by utricular ganglion cells. 
      Dorsally located columns received projections from nerves with dorsal peripheral 
      connections, and more ventrally located columns received projections from nerves 
      with ventral peripheral connections. This relation is the reverse of that seen in 
      other vertebrates.

TI  - Expression of Na(+) / H(+) exchanger mRNA in the gills of the Atlantic hagfish 
      (Myxine glutinosa) in response to metabolic acidosis.
PG  - 81-91
AB  - Sodium/proton exchangers (NHE) are transmembrane proteins that facilitate the 
      exchange of a Na(+) ion for a H(+) ion across cellular membranes. The NHE are 
      present in the gills of fishes and are believed to function in acid-base regulation 
      by driving the extrusion of protons across the branchial epithelium in exchange for 
      Na(+) in the water. In this study, we have used reverse transcriptase-polymerase 
      chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the presence of a branchial NHE in the gills of 
      the Atlantic hagfish, Myxine glutinosa. The subsequent partial cDNA sequence shares 
      homology with other vertebrate and invertebrate NHE isoforms. In addition, using 
      semi-quantitative, multiplex RT-PCR we demonstrate that mRNA expression of hagfish 
      gill NHE is upregulated following an induced metabolic acidosis. Expression was 
      increased to 4.4 times basal levels at 2-h post-infusion and had decreased to 1.6 
      times basal by 6 h. Expression had returned to basal levels by 24-h post-infusion. 
      The inference from this study is that a gill NHE which is potentially important in 
      acid-base regulation has been present in the vertebrate lineage since before the 
      divergence of the hagfishes from the main vertebrate line.

TI  - Immunohistochemical localisation of natriuretic peptides in the brains and hearts of 
      the spiny dogfish Squalus acanthias and the Atlantic hagfish Myxine glutinosa.
PG  - 535-45
AB  - The avidin-biotin peroxidase technique was used to determine the distribution of 
      natriuretic peptides in the hearts and brains of the dogfish Squalus acanthias and 
      the Atlantic hagfish Myxine glutinosa. Three antisera were used: one raised against 
      porcine brain natriuretic peptide which cross-reacts with atrial natriuretic and 
      C-type natriuretic peptides (termed natriuretic peptide-like immunoreactivity); the 
      second raised against porcine brain natriuretic peptide which cross-reacts with 
      C-type natriuretic peptide, but not with atrial natriuretic peptide (termed porcine 
      brain natriuretic peptide-like immunoreactivity); and the third raised against rat 
      atrial natriuretic peptide (termed rat atrial natriuretic peptide-like 
      immunoreactivity). Only natriuretic peptide-like immunoreactivity was observed in 
      the heart of S. acanthias which was most likely due to the antiserum cross-reacting 
      with C-type natriuretic peptide. No immunoreactivity was found in the M. glutinosa 
      heart. In the brain of S. acanthias, natriuretic peptide-like immunoreactive fibres 
      were located in many areas of the telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, 
      rhombencephalon, and spinal cord. Extensive immunoreactivity was observed in the 
      hypothalamo-hypophyseal tract and the neurointermediate lobe of the hypophysis. 
      Natriuretic peptide-like immunoreactive perikarya were found in ventromedial regions 
      of the telencephalon and in the nucleus preopticus. Most perikarya had short, thick 
      processes which extended toward the ventricle. Another group of perikarya was 
      observed in the rhombencephalon. Porcine brain natriuretic peptide-like 
      immunoreactive fibres were observed in the telencephalon, diencephalon, 
      mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon, but perikarya were only present in the preoptic 
      area. In the M. glutinosa brain, natriuretic peptide-like immunoreactive fibres were 
      present in all regions. Immunoreactive perikarya were observed in the pallium, 
      primordium hippocampi, pars ventralis thalami, pars dorsalis thalami, nucleus 
      diffusus hypothalami, nucleus profundus, nucleus tuberculi posterioris, and nucleus 
      ventralis tegmenti. Porcine brain natriuretic peptide-like immunoreactive perikarya 
      and fibres had a similar, but less abundant distribution than natriuretic 
      peptide-like immunoreactive structures. Although the chemical structures of 
      natriuretic peptides in the brains of dogfish and hagfish are unknown, these 
      observations show that a component of the natriuretic peptide complement is similar 
      to porcine brain natriuretic peptide or porcine C-type natriuretic peptide. The 
      presence of natriuretic peptides in the brain suggest they could be important 
      neuromodulators and/or neurotransmitters. Furthermore, there appears to be 
      divergence in the structural forms of natriuretic peptides in the hearts and brains 
      of dogfish and hagfish.

TI  - The notochord of hagfish Myxine glutinosa: visco-elastic properties and mechanical 
      functions during steady swimming.
PG  - 3819-31
AB  - To determine the possible locomotor functions of the hagfish notochord, we measured 
      its flexural stiffness EI (N m(-2)) and flexural damping C (kg m(3) s(-1)), under in 
      vitro conditions that mimicked the body curvature and bending frequency measured 
      during steady undulatory swimming. To assess the notochord's contribution to the 
      mechanical behavior of the whole body, we also measured EI and C of the whole body, 
      the body with skin removed, and the notochord with the outer fibrous sheath removed. 
      When subjected to dynamic bending at angular frequencies from pi to 6pi rad s(-1) 
      and midline curvatures from 11 to 40 m(-1), 1 cm in situ body segments (N=4), 
      located at an axial position of 37% of the body length, showed significant changes 
      in EI, C, the Young's modulus or material stiffness (E, MPa), the net work to bend 
      the body over a cycle (W, J) and resilience (R, % energy return). When skin, muscles 
      and the outer fibrous sheath of the notochord were removed sequentially, each 
      structural reduction yielded significant changes in mechanical properties: C 
      decreased when the skin was removed, E increased when the muscles were removed, and 
      EI and R decreased when the outer fibrous sheath was removed. Although occupying 
      only a small portion of the cross-sectional area, the notochord provides the body 
      with 75% of its total EI and 80% of total C, by virtue of its high E, ranging from 4 
      to 8 MPa, which is an order of magnitude greater than that of the whole body. Thus, 
      as the body's primary source of EI and C, the notochord determines the passive (i.e. 
      internal, non-muscular) mechanical behavior of the swimming hagfish. EI and C covary 
      inversely and non-linearly such that as C increases, EI decreases. However, the 
      bending moments M (Nm) produced by each property increase proportionally, and the 
      ratio of stiffness to damping moments, also known as the amplification ratio at 
      resonance, is nearly invariant (approximately 7) with changes in driving frequency. 
      If the body operates in life at or near resonance, the variables EI and C interact 
      over a range of swimming speeds to produce passive mechanical stability.

TI  - High matrix interference affecting detection of PAH metabolites in bile of Atlantic 
      hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) used for biomonitoring of deep-water oil production.
PG  - 369-74
LID - 10.1016/j.marenvres.2011.04.006 [doi]
AB  - The characteristic biology and wide distribution of hagfish species makes them 
      relevant for use in pollution biomonitoring at great water depths, particularly in 
      regions where deep-water oil production may take place. The exposure of fish to 
      petrogenic contaminants can normally be detected from the level of polycyclic 
      aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolites in bile fluid. Some of these metabolites are 
      strong fluorophores, allowing analytical detection by means of simple fluorometric 
      techniques such as fixed wavelength fluorescence (FF) and synchronous fluorescence 
      scanning (SFS). In the present study bile from Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) 
      collected in pristine areas (Barents Sea and southwestern Norway) displayed strong 
      bile fluorescence levels, suggesting the presence of PAH contaminants. However, 
      gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses ruled out PAHs as the origin 
      for this fluorescence signal. Rather, the bile of Myxine contains components 
      resulting in unusually strong background fluorescence interfering at the wavelength 
      pairs used for detection of PAH metabolites. Possible background for the observed 
      matrix interference and implications for detection of PAH metabolites in hagfish is 
      discussed.

PG  - 280-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1095-8649.2011.03028.x [doi]
AB  - The rate of velar movement in Eptatretus cirrhatus, as determined by 
      electromyography, increased with Q(10) 3·2 during exposure to temperatures between 7 
      and 19° C and increased 3·9 fold during exposure to hypoxia (oxygen partial pressure 
      = 6·67 kPa). This confirms the role of the velum in generating respiratory currents 
      and modification of its activity in response to changes in metabolic demand or 
      environmental oxygen availability. The maximum velar rate observed was 168 beats 
      min(-1) , higher than that recorded in any hagfish species to date. Fibres of 
      musculus craniovelaris were exclusively small, red (slow-twitch) fibres, consistent 
      with a high aerobic capacity required by fibres involved in rhythmic, ongoing 
      activity.

TI  - The forebrain of the Pacific hagfish: a cladistic reconstruction of the ancestral 
      craniate forebrain.
PG  - 25-64
AB  - The forebrain of the Pacific hagfish is described with regard to its morphology, 
      cytoarchitecture, and secondary olfactory projections. The forebrain ventricular 
      system is greatly reduced in adult hagfishes, although vestiges of ventricular 
      structures can still be recognized. In order to clarify topographical relationships 
      within the forebrain, we provide a three-dimensional reconstruction of the 
      ventricular system, including the vestigial portions. Topography and embryology lead 
      us to conclude that the 'primordium hippocampi' of previous authors is a 
      diencephalic structure. For topographical and hodological reasons, we interpret the 
      'area basalis' of previous authors to be part of the preoptic region, and we 
      identify a part of the so-called 'nucleus olfactorius anterior' as the homologue of 
      the striatum. The laminated pallium is dominated by secondary olfactory projections 
      and shows a high degree of regional cytoarchitectural specialization, as does the 
      entire forebrain. In all, 42 cell groups are identified in the forebrain of 
      hagfishes (compared to only about 25 in lampreys, for example). This surprisingly 
      high degree of cytoarchitectural complexity prompted us to re-examine the 
      phylogenetic history of craniate brains with this complexity in mind. In this paper 
      we use cladistic methodology to reconstruct a morphotype, and we conclude that the 
      forebrains of the earliest craniates may have been more complex than previously 
      believed. This reconstruction includes hypotheses regarding the general morphology, 
      secondary olfactory system, and visual system, as well as the relative sizes of 
      major divisions of the forebrain in the earliest craniates.

TI  - Glomerular bypass shunts in the kidney of the Atlantic hagfish, Myxine glutinosa.
PG  - 377-81
AB  - The vascular pathways associated with the glomerulus of the Atlantic hagfish, Myxine 
      glutinosa have been studied by scanning electron microscopy of corroded resin casts 
      of the vasculature. Although the overall pattern of the renal vasculature did not 
      differ from earlier reports, a previously unreported vascular pathway which arose 
      from the renal artery and bypassed the glomerular capillaries in 28% of glomeruli 
      was clearly demonstrated. Glomerular bypass shunts either ran to join the loose 
      capillary network around Bowman's capsule and thereby drain into the network of 
      vessels associated with the mesonephric duct (ureter), or ran directly into the 
      ureteral system of vessels and subsequently into the posterior cardinal veins. 
      Glomerular bypass shunts which theoretically permit renal arterial blood to bypass 
      the process of filtration may play a role in the regulation of body fluid volume.

TI  - Study on the accumulation of heavy metals in shallow-water and deep-sea hagfishes.
PG  - 643-53
LID - 10.1007/s00244-010-9572-8 [doi]
AB  - Hagfish, the plesiomorphic sister group of all vertebrates, are scavengers, and many 
      of them live at depths reaching thousands of meters. They are caught for use as food 
      and serve as a substitute for leather in crafts in Asian hagfisheries. At present, 
      the amount of various pollutants present in hagfishes from bioaccumulation through 
      the food chain is unknown. To understand the bioaccumulation characteristics of 
      heavy metals in deep-sea scavengers, selected heavy metals, including iron (Fe), 
      manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), selenium (Se), cadmium (Cd), 
      mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb), were analyzed and compared in two hagfish species, 
      Paramyxine nelsoni (Pn) (found at approximately 200 m) and Myxine formosana (Mf) 
      (found at approximately 850 m) caught in southwestern Taiwanese waters. Hagfish 
      muscle (PnM and MfM) and liver (PnL and MfL) samples were lyophilized, and their 
      metal levels were then analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma mass 
      spectrometer. The metals with the highest levels in Pn tissues included Cu and As 
      (PnL > MfL and PnM > MfM); in contrast, those that were higher in Mf tissues were 
      Cd, Hg (both MfL > PnL and MfM > PnM), and Zn (MfM > PnM). Multivariate analyses, 
      i.e., principle component analysis and partial least squares for discriminant 
      analysis of metal levels were able to clearly separate these four tissue types into 
      two groups corresponding to the two species: Pn and Mf. The present data also show 
      differences in the levels of certain heavy metals in these tissues of the two 
      hagfish species. These differences might have resulted not only from depth-related 
      environmental factors but also from different species' accumulation characteristics. 
      Fe, Cu, and Hg concentrations were much higher in hagfish muscle than have been 
      found in other fishes from adjacent polluted regions, and Hg was approximately 10- 
      to 100-fold higher in hagfish muscles. Public health issues related to the 
      consumption of hagfish are also discussed.

TI  - Hagfish in the New Zealand fjords are supported by chemoautotrophy of forest carbon.
PG  - 809-16
AB  - Forest litter is often considered to be a minor energy source to marine communities 
      due to its refractory nature. Large volumes of forest litter are deposited in the 
      New Zealand fjords, and likely recycled into available energy by microbial activity. 
      In this study we used evidence from stable isotope analyses to test whether recycled 
      carbon from chemoautotrophs was an important contributor to the diet of hagfish 
      (Eptatretus cirrhatus). We then analyzed fatty acid biomarkers from the 
      chemoautotrophic clam Solemya parkinsoni and E. cirrhatus to further discriminate 
      the contribution of marine, terrestrial, and chemoautotrophic sources. Bulk isotopic 
      signatures of E. cirrhatus varied considerably (delta13C, from -29.2 per thousand to 
      -16.7 per thousand; delta15N, from -2.8 per thousand to +15.5 per thousand; 
      delta34S, from -21.7 per thousand to +16.7 per thousand) and indicated that a 
      significant percentage of organic matter (38-51%) originated from chemoautotrophs 
      (delta13C, -31.3 per thousand +/- 0.1 per thousand [mean +/- SE]; delta15N, -5.7 per 
      thousand +/- 0.2 per thousand; delta34S, -32.per thousand +/- 3.8 per thousand). 
      Fatty acid biomarkers were depleted in 13C, particularly cis-vaccenic acid 
      (18:1omega7: delta13C, -39.0 per thousand) indicating specific microbial origins of 
      carbon. A high proportion of forest litter in sediments, coupled with isotopic and 
      fatty acid biomarker results, indicates that terrestrial organic matter is a 
      dominant contributor to this marine benthic system. This study demonstrates a clear 
      linkage between terrestrial and marine ecological processes.

TI  - Genome biology of the cyclostomes and insights into the evolutionary biology of 
      vertebrate genomes.
PG  - 130-7
LID - 10.1093/icb/icq023 [doi]
AB  - The jawless vertebrates (lamprey and hagfish) are the closest extant outgroups to 
      all jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) and can therefore provide critical insight into 
      the evolution and basic biology of vertebrate genomes. As such, it is notable that 
      the genomes of lamprey and hagfish possess a capacity for rearrangement that is 
      beyond anything known from the gnathostomes. Like the jawed vertebrates, lamprey and 
      hagfish undergo rearrangement of adaptive immune receptors. However, the receptors 
      and the mechanisms for rearrangement that are utilized by jawless vertebrates 
      clearly evolved independently of the gnathostome system. Unlike the jawed 
      vertebrates, lamprey and hagfish also undergo extensive programmed rearrangements of 
      the genome during embryonic development. By considering these fascinating genome 
      biologies in the context of proposed (albeit contentious) phylogenetic relationships 
      among lamprey, hagfish, and gnathostomes, we can begin to understand the 
      evolutionary history of the vertebrate genome. Specifically, the deep shared 
      ancestry and rapid divergence of lampreys, hagfish and gnathostomes is considered 
      evidence that the two versions of programmed rearrangement present in lamprey and 
      hagfish (embryonic and immune receptor) were present in an ancestral lineage that 
      existed more than 400 million years ago and perhaps included the ancestor of the 
      jawed vertebrates. Validating this premise will require better characterization of 
      the genome sequence and mechanisms of rearrangement in lamprey and hagfish.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of hagfish thyroid iodoprotein by its 
      non-thyroglobulin nature, very high iodine and carbohydrate contents and low 
      hormone/iodine ratio.
PG  - 11-8
AB  - We have characterized the thyroid iodoprotein of a hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri, one 
      of the lowest marine vertebrates. The iodoprotein was not very homogeneous in its 
      apparent molecular mass which decreased with the increase in hormone/iodotyrosine 
      ratio. Four subfractions with an apparent molecular mass of about 400 kDa were 
      purified from one major fraction by size-exclusion and Mono Q ion-exchange HPLC. The 
      subfractions appeared to have the same peptide backbone, since they showed a single 
      band with the same mobility as a 160-kDa protein in SDS/PAGE and the same amino acid 
      composition. However they differed from each other in having increasing iodine 
      contents (1.9% to 5.9% by mass of total amino acids) associated with the increase in 
      hormonal iodine proportion (8.4% to 16.7% of total iodine) and carbohydrate content 
      (35.6% to 53.5% by mass). These values are strikingly different from those of 
      thyroglobulin with an iodine content of less than 1%, hormonal iodine of 20-40% and 
      carbohydrate content of less than 10%. The amino acid composition of the hagfish 
      iodoprotein, especially the cysteine content of less than 1%, was also entirely 
      different from that of thyroglobulin. These results suggest that most, if not all, 
      tyrosine residues of the hagfish thyroid glycoprotein with a less rigid structure 
      are susceptible to an iodinating system, but hormone residues are formed by a much 
      less efficient mechanism than those in thyroglobulin, when poorly iodinated.

TI  - Complete mitochondrial DNA of the hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri: the comparative 
      analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences strongly supports the cyclostome monophyly.
PG  - 184-92
AB  - The phylogenetic position of cyclostomes, i.e., the relationships between hagfishes, 
      lampreys, and jawed vertebrates is an unresolved problem. Anatomical data support 
      the paraphyly of cyclostomes, whereas nuclear genes data support monophyly of 
      cyclostomes. Previous results obtained using mitochondrial DNA are ambiguous, 
      presumably due to a lack of informative sequences. By adding the complete mtDNA of a 
      hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri, we have generated a novel data set for sequences of 
      hagfishes and of lampreys. The addition of this mtDNA sequence to the 12 taxa we 
      have already used becomes sufficient to obtain unambiguous results. This data set, 
      which includes sequences of mtDNA of animals closely related to the lamprey/hagfish 
      node, was used in a phylogenetic analysis with two independent statistical 
      approaches and unequivocally supported the monophyly of cyclostomes. Thus molecular 
      data, i.e., our results and those obtained using nuclear genes, conclude that 
      hagfishes and lampreys form a clade.

TI  - The leukocyte common antigen (CD45) of the Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii: 
      implications for the primordial function of CD45.
PG  - 286-91
AB  - CD45, originally known as the leukocyte common antigen, is a prototypical 
      transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase that plays a critical role in signal 
      transduction through T-cell and B-cell receptors, as well as in T-cell and B-cell 
      development. In the present study, we show that the Pacific hagfish, widely believed 
      to lack the adaptive immune system, has CD45. The presence of CD45 in jawless fish 
      is consistent with the recent discovery that CD45 also plays a crucial role in 
      innate immunity via the regulation of signaling through type I and type II cytokine 
      receptors. It is likely that CD45 was recruited to activate lymphocytes through 
      antigen receptors encoded by rearranging genes in jawed vertebrates.

      glutinosa.
PG  - 573-83
AB  - The intramembrane organization of the occluding junctions in the gill epithelium of 
      the Atlantic hagfish, Myxine glutinosa, was studied by means of freeze-fracture 
      electron microscopy. Mitochondria-rich cells, characterized by assemblies of 
      rod-shaped particles in the luminal plasma membrane and by an extensive 
      intracellular amplification of the basolateral plasma membrane, are singly 
      distributed between the pavement cells in the gill epithelium of this marine and 
      stenohaline cyclostome. The occluding junctions between mitochondria-rich cells and 
      pavement cells do not differ from those between adjacent pavement cells, concerning 
      the number of superimposed strands (median 6, range 4-9) and their geometrical 
      organization. These observations suggest that, in contrast to marine teleosts, the 
      paracellular pathway plays a minor role in transepithelial ion movements in the 
      hagfish gill epithelium. The findings are in agreement with the absence of 
      hypoosmoregulatory mechanisms in hagfish, as have been evolved in various marine 
      vertebrates. In addition, small communicating junctions are demonstrated between 
      pavement cells; they possibly serve for a coordinated synthesis and secretion of 
      mucus by the pavement cells.

TI  - Effects of salinity manipulations on blood pressures in an osmoconforming chordate, 
      the hagfish, Eptatretus cirrhatus.
PG  - 31-9
AB  - Arterial and venous pressures were measured in hagfishes subjected to acute changes 
      in salinity. The osmotic pressure of the seawater (SW) was increased or decreased by 
      approximately 10%. Sixty minutes after the change in medium osmolarity the osmotic 
      pressure of the blood corresponded with that of the medium. Following transfer to 
      90% SW all measured parameters changed as predicted for a passive increase in blood 
      volume, apart from the pressure in the posterior cardinal vein (PCV) which fell. By 
      2 h dorsal aortic (DA) pressure and pressure in the PCV and supraintestinal vein had 
      returned to pre-change values. In contrast, following exposure to 110% SW, pressures 
      fell and apart from the supraintestinal vein they remained low at 120 min. At 24 h, 
      DA pressure was lower than pre-change values for both groups. The data are 
      consistent with the concept of central venous tone being regulated in hagfishes, 
      which cope better with volume expansion than volume depletion.

TI  - Secondary olfactory projections and pallial topography in the Pacific hagfish, 
      Eptatretus stouti.
PG  - 529-42
AB  - The extent of the secondary olfactory projections shows great variation among 
      different groups of craniates. Gnathostomes typically display restricted secondary 
      olfactory projections, whereas lampreys have more extensive projections. Any attempt 
      to determine the phylogenetic polarity of these characters, that is, to decide which 
      is primitive and which is derived, requires an investigation of the secondary 
      olfactory system in the sister group of lampreys and gnathostomes, the hagfishes. 
      Therefore the secondary olfactory projections of the Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus 
      stouti, were traced with the use of horseradish peroxidase and the lipophilic 
      fluorescent tracing compound DiI. The projections are bilateral and massive to all 
      pallial areas and the septum, moderate to the striatum, and relatively weak to the 
      preoptic and infundibular regions of the hypothalamus, reaching caudally to the 
      diencephalic-mesencephalic boundary. Afferents to the olfactory bulb arise from the 
      pallium, the preoptic area, and the ventral thalamus. We compare the secondary 
      olfactory projections in hagfishes with those in lampreys and in gnathostomes, and 
      we conclude that the presence of extensive secondary olfactory projections is a 
      primitive character of craniate brains.

PG  - 209-14
AB  - The modal number of chromosomes in Eptatretus burgeri was 36 in 297 (81.8%) of 363 
      somatic cells, 52 in 13 (30.2%) of 43 spermatogonia, and 25 (46.8%) or 26 (40.3%) in 
      162 of 186 first spermatocytes. The relative amount of DNA in a somatic cell to that 
      in a spermatogonium averaged 79.2%. C-band-positive chromatin was observed along 
      almost the entire length of the associated dumbbell-shaped bivalents and part of two 
      other bivalents in the metaphases of first spermatocytes, but was rarely observed in 
      somatic cells. These results indicate that, in E. burgeri, chromosome elimination 
      takes place during the early stages of cleavage, except for the ancestral germ-line 
      cells.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of a protein from hagfish serum that is homologous to 
      the third component of the mammalian complement system.
PG  - 117-23
AB  - The 192-kDa protein HX, a major component of serum that specifically binds to 
      zymosan particles, was prepared from the plasma of the hagfish (Eptatretus burgeri) 
      by ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration. HX, present at a concentration of 
      0.8 mg/ml in the original plasma, was composed of two distinct subunits of 115 kDa 
      and 77 kDa, respectively, which were linked by disulfide bonds. The protein had the 
      same electrophoretic mobility as beta-globulin. Digestion by trypsin resulted in a 
      specific cleavage of the 115-kDa subunit and a change in its immunoelectrophoretic 
      mobility in the anodal direction, leaving the 77-kDa subunit intact. Treatment with 
      SDS and urea resulted in the splitting of the 115-kDa subunits into 68-kDa and 
      45-kDa components, but this splitting was inhibited by pretreatment with 
      methylamine, suggesting the presence of a thiol ester bond in the 115-kDa subunit. 
      The amino acid composition of HX revealed a striking resemblance to that of human 
      C3. We conclude, therefore, that the 192-kDa protein isolated in this study is 
      analogous to C3, which plays a key role in the mammalian C system.

TI  - A possible retinal information route to the circadian pacemaker through pretectal 
      areas in the hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri.
PG  - 201-4
AB  - By recording the locomotor activity rhythm of hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri, in which 
      surgical lesions of the pretectal areas were made, we searched for the route of 
      light information from the eyes to the circadian pacemaker, which is considered to 
      be located in the preoptic nucleus. The entrainment of circadian activity rhythm to 
      the light dark cycle, under 12 h light/12 h dark (12L:12D) was lost in animals whose 
      pretectum was ablated with a pair of scissors and the animals then showed a 
      free-running rhythm. Destruction of the pretectal areas with a high-frequency lesion 
      generator also caused a free-running rhythm under 12L:12D. These findings indicate 
      that retinal information may entrain the circadian rhythm via the pretectal areas, 
      which have retinofugal connections.

TI  - Immunoglobulin-bearing blood leucocytes in the Pacific hagfish.
PG  - 99-108
AB  - The occurrence of immunoglobulin (Ig) bearing leucocytes in the blood of the Pacific 
      hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii , was examined using a murine monoclonal antibody (45.3) 
      and a rabbit antiserum specific for hagfish serum Ig. Binding of antibody 45.3 to 
      hagfish leucocytes assessed by radioimmunoassay was inhibited by preincubation of 
      antibody with purified serum Ig thus verifying the presence of cell surface Ig cross 
      reactive with serum Ig. The monoclonal antibody identified approximately 65% of 
      blood leucocytes as Ig+ve while the rabbit antiserum indicated 81% Ig+ve cells. Both 
      antibody preparations failed to react specifically with cells from mouse, horned 
      shark, tunicate or sea star; this indicates the distinctive nature of hagfish Ig. 
      The high percentage of blood cells bearing surface Ig in the hagfish raises the 
      possibility that lymphocyte divergence to separate B and T pathways may not have 
      occurred in this most primitive vertebrate. Alternatively, an Ig-like specificity 
      characteristic of both "T" and "B" lymphocytes may have been detected. In any event, 
      a subset of Ig negative leucocytes is evident in hagfish.

TI  - Genes coding for intermediate filament proteins closely related to the hagfish 
      "thread keratins (TK)" alpha and gamma also exist in lamprey, teleosts and 
      amphibians.
PG  - 1447-62
AB  - The "thread keratins (TK)" alpha and gamma so far have been considered highly 
      specialized intermediate filament (IF) proteins restricted to hagfish. From lamprey, 
      we now have sequenced five novel IF proteins closely related to TKalpha and TKgamma, 
      respectively. Moreover, we have detected corresponding sequences in EST and genomic 
      databases of teleosts and amphibians. The structure of the TKalpha genes and the 
      positions of their deduced amino acid sequences in a phylogenetic tree clearly 
      support their classification as type II keratins. The genes encoding TKgamma show a 
      structure typical for type III IF proteins, whereas their positions in phylogenetic 
      trees favor a close relationship to the type I keratins. Considering that most 
      keratin-like sequences detected in the lancelet also exhibit a gene structure 
      typical for type III IF proteins, it seems likely that the keratin gene(s) 
      originated from an ancient type III IF protein gene. According to EST analyses, the 
      expression of the thread keratins in teleost fish and amphibians may be particularly 
      restricted to larval stages, which, in conjunction with the observed absence of 
      TKalpha and TKgamma genes in any of the available Amniota databases, indicates a 
      thread keratin function closely related to larval development in an aquatic 
      environment.

TI  - The branchial circulation and the gill epithelia in the Atlantic hagfish, Myxine 
      glutinosa L.
PG  - 489-504
AB  - The vessels of the branchial circulation of the Atlantic hagfish, Myxine glutinosa, 
      and their relationship with the gill epithelia have been studied by light and 
      electron microscopy. The inner surface of the pouch wall (containing the 
      interconnected radial arteries) and the afferent and efferent unbranched portions 
      (cavernous tissues) of the radially oriented gill folds are covered by a 
      multilayered epithelium. The lamellar portion that is characterized by pillar cells 
      is lined by a thin bilayered epithelium. The thin-walled sinusoid system is part of 
      an arterio-venous circulation. This is demonstrated by the presence of 
      arterio-venous anastomoses and by the connection to the peribranchial sinus. The 
      sinusoid system has a close spatial relationship to the multilayered epithelium. The 
      multilayered epithelium consists of pavement cells, cells of the medial layer and 
      basal cells. Granulated cells are often found in the basal half of the epithelium. 
      The pavement cells are characterized by large vesicles in close apposition to the 
      apical plasma membrane. Ionocytes, which display a cytoplasmic tubular system that 
      is continuous with the intercellular space, a high number of mitochondria, and small 
      apical vesicles, are present. The occurence of the ionocytes in the afferent 
      multilayered epithelium as well as the bilayered lamellar epithelium, the morphology 
      of the ionocyte, and the absence of accessory cells is reminiscent of the freshwater 
      teleost gill, and in part the elasmobranch gill, and is discussed in relation to 
      osmo- and ion regulation.

TI  - The occurrence and distribution of GnRH in the brain of Atlantic hagfish, an 
      agnatha, determined by chromatography and immunocytochemistry.
PG  - 300-7
AB  - In Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa), chromatographic and immunocytochemical 
      evidence showed that the brain contains a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-like 
      molecule that is closely related to lamprey GnRH-III. The chromatographic studies 
      (HPLC) used specific antisera directed against mammalian GnRH and lamprey GnRH-I. In 
      addition to these antisera, other specific antisera were tested in 
      immunocytochemical studies, including chicken GnRH-I, chicken-GnRH-II, salmon GnRH, 
      and lamprey GnRH-III. Using a lamprey GnRH-I antiserum, an early eluting GnRH form 
      coeluted on HPLC with lamprey GnRH-III standard and an unknown form coeluted with 
      the chicken GnRH-II standard. Radioimmunoassay of brain tissue detected GnRH 
      immunoreactivity only when the lamprey GnRH-I antibody was used. A GnRH-like 
      immunoreactivity was also obtained immunocytochemically in the neurohypophysis with 
      the use of antisera against chicken GnRH-II, salmon GnRH, lamprey GnRH-I, and 
      lamprey GnRH-III. These studies indicate that, contrary to earlier reports, hagfish 
      do have a GnRH-like molecule that is more closely related, in terms of immunological 
      determinants, to lamprey GnRH-III than to other currently known vertebrate GnRH 
      molecules.

TI  - Emptying and refilling of slime glands in Atlantic (Myxine glutinosa) and Pacific 
      (Eptatretus stoutii) hagfishes.
LID - jeb172254 [pii]
LID - 10.1242/jeb.172254 [doi]
AB  - Hagfishes are known for their unique defensive slime, which they use to ward off 
      gill-breathing predators. Although much is known about the slime cells (gland thread 
      cells and gland mucous cells), little is known about how long slime gland refilling 
      takes, or how slime composition changes with refilling or repeated stimulation of 
      the same gland. Slime glands can be individually electrostimulated to release slime, 
      and this technique was used to measure slime gland refilling times for Atlantic and 
      Pacific hagfish. The amount of exudate produced, the composition of the exudate and 
      the morphometrics of slime cells were analyzed during refilling, and as a function 
      of stimulation number when full glands were stimulated in rapid succession. Complete 
      refilling of slime glands for both species took 3-4 weeks, with Pacific hagfish 
      achieving faster absolute rates of exudate recovery than Atlantic hagfish. We found 
      significant changes in the composition of the exudate and in the morphometrics of 
      slime cells from Pacific hagfish during refilling. Over successive stimulations of 
      full Pacific hagfish glands, multiple boluses of exudate were released, with exudate 
      composition, but not thread cell morphometrics, changing significantly. Finally, 
      histological examination of slime glands revealed slime cells retained in glands 
      after exhaustion. Discrepancies in the volume of cells released suggest that 
      mechanisms other than contraction of the gland musculature alone may be involved in 
      exudate ejection. Our results provide a first look at the process and timing of 
      slime gland refilling in hagfishes, and raise new questions about how refilling is 
      achieved at the cellular level.

TI  - Blood flow to the pancreatic islet parenchyma of the Atlantic hagfish (Myxine 
      glutinosa).
PG  - 182-7
AB  - The islet organ of the Atlantic hagfish, a cyclostome, phylogenetically is the most 
      original islet parenchyma. It is well equipped with blood vessels, but lacks nerves. 
      The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relative proportions between 
      regional blood flows in these animals with a microsphere technique and with 
      laser-Doppler flowmetry. As regards the results obtained in the kidneys, gills, and 
      islet organ, the data were essentially the same found using both methods. 
      Approximately 20% of the injected microspheres were found in the kidneys; when 
      corrected for weight, the gill bodies and the islet organ were also found to have 
      the same blood perfusion. The blood flow to the brain and that of the gut and the 
      liver were only approximately 30% and 10%, respectively, of that to the kidney. 
      Topical application of the nitric oxide donor, sodium nitroprusside failed to affect 
      the islet blood flow. Apart from this observation, this non-innervated "primitive" 
      islet parenchyma did not differ from that of the amply innervated mammalian islets 
      with regard to their high basal blood perfusion.

AB  - Inferences of the ancestral vertebrate are increasingly complex because the 
      previously understudied cyclostomes have been revealed as simplified and 
      specialised. New research uncovers another ancestral vertebrate character, resolving 
      a century of debate over whether the ancestral vertebrate bore gills.

TI  - Highly repetitive DNA sequences that are restricted to the germ line in the hagfish 
      Eptatretus cirrhatus: a mosaic of eliminated elements.
PG  - 17-32
AB  - The New Zealand hagfish, Eptatretus cirrhatus, is known to eliminate parts of its 
      chromosomes during embryogenesis from presumptive somatic cells. Electrophoresis of 
      germ line and somatic DNAs of this species, after treatment with the restriction 
      endonucleases DraI and EcoRI, revealed three fragments of DNA that were restricted 
      to the germ line. DNA filter hybridization experiments demonstrated that these 
      fragments were present almost exclusively in the germ line DNA of E. cirrhatus and 
      that they were highly and tandemly repeated. Thus, these DNA fragments appeared to 
      be eliminated during embryogenesis. Moreover, one fragment (a DraI fragment) 
      cross-hybridized with the germ line DNA from other species of hagfish, namely, 
      Eptatretus okinoseanus and Paramyxine atami. Molecular cloning and sequence analysis 
      revealed that the DraI fragment was composed mainly of closely related sequences of 
      85 bp in length and that this sequence was about 75% homologous to the sequence of 
      EEEo2 (eliminated element of E. okinoseanus 2) which is a germ line-restricted and 
      highly repetitive sequence that was isolated previously from E. okinoseanus. The 
      other two fragments were composed of three families of closely related sequences 
      that were 172 bp long (designated EEEc1), 61 bp long (EEEc2) and 54 bp long (EEEc3). 
      Fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments revealed that each eliminated element 
      was distributed on several chromosomes that are limited to germ cells. EEEo2 was 
      dispersed on 12 C-band-positive chromosomes. EEEc1 and EEEc3 were dispersed on all 
      C-band-positive and several C-band-negative chromosomes. By contrast, EEEc2 was 
      located to terminal regions of several C-band-negative chromosomes. These results 
      suggest that the eliminated chromosomes in hagfish are mosaics of highly repeated, 
      germ line-restricted families of DNA sequences.

TI  - Neuronal organization of the optic tectum in the hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri: a 
      Golgi study.
PG  - 271-9
AB  - The neuronal organization of the optic tectum (OT) was studied in the hagfish using 
      the rapid Golgi method. The OT shows laminar structure. Beginning from the 
      ventricular surface, the following four concentric strata are discernible: the 
      stratum ependymale, stratum periventriculare, stratum cellulare et fibrosum, and 
      stratum marginale. The stratum ependymale consists of several rows of ependymal 
      cells and neuroblasts lining the mesencephalic ventricle. The stratum 
      periventriculare contains medium-sized and small neurons whose dendrites extend 
      mainly superficially. The stratum cellulare et fibrosum occupies a wide area and 
      consists of densely packed neurons and fibers. Fibers in this stratum are derived 
      mainly from the bulbar lemniscus and run ventrodorsally in several bundles, among 
      which numerous neurons are embedded. Neurons in the stratum cellulare et fibrosum 
      are divided into large, medium-sized and small neurons whose dendrites are arranged 
      in a network rather than being oriented in any particular direction. Some of these 
      dendrites extend contralaterally through the commissure of the OT. The neurons in 
      the stratum marginale are divided into medium-sized and small neurons whose 
      dendrites extend mainly tangentially. The axons of neurons in the stratum 
      periventriculare and those of a few neurons in the stratum cellulare et fibrosum 
      extend rostromedially and can be traced into the stratum periventriculare. On the 
      other hand, the axons of neurons in the stratum marginale and stratum cellulare et 
      fibrosum run rostrally, turn ventrally and join fiber bundles running 
      dorsoventrally.

TI  - Component C3 of hagfish complement has a unique structure: identification of native 
      C3 and its degradation products.
PG  - 633-42
AB  - A protein from hagfish serum that cross-reacted with the third component of hagfish 
      complement (C3) was purified to homogeneity and its structural properties were 
      compared with those of C3 which has a two-subunit chain structure (115 and 72 kDa). 
      This protein (designated C3b), when purified from plasma, consisted of three 
      disulfide-linked polypeptide chains (77, 72 and 30 kDa). On immunoelectrophoresis, 
      purified C3b migrated more rapidly towards the anode than the beta mobility of C3. 
      However, immunochemical analysis revealed that C3b, after the first step in its 
      purification, consisted of two disulfide-linked polypeptide chains (105 and 72 kDa). 
      Treatment of C3b with methylamine, prior to spectrophotometric titration of the free 
      sulfhydryl groups, did not significantly affect the end-point of the titration, 
      suggesting the absence of a thioester bond in this molecule. Analysis of the amino 
      acid sequences of the amino-termini of the subunits of C3b revealed that 77 amino 
      acid residues at the amino-terminus of the native alpha chain were missing from both 
      the 77-kDa and the 105-kDa polypeptides from C3b. These results indicate that the 
      C3b in this study was analogous to mammalian C3b. Furthermore, amino acid sequencing 
      data indicated that most of the native C3 from hagfish serum has an irregular 
      two-subunit (alpha+gamma and beta)-linked structure, as a result of one-sided 
      processing of putative hagfish pro-C3 at the beta-alpha processing site exclusively. 
      Moreover, it appears that only the molecular features of degenerated hagfish C3 
      (C3b) are altered during its purification to generate a three-chain structure.

TI  - Germ line-restricted, highly repeated DNA sequences and their chromosomal 
      localization in a Japanese hagfish (Eptatretus okinoseanus).
PG  - 163-73
AB  - The various species of Japanese hagfish, namely, Eptatretus okinoseanus (types A and 
      B), Eptatretus burgeri and Myxine garmani, are known to eliminate a fraction of 
      their chromosomes during early embryogenesis. High molecular weight DNA from germ 
      line cells and somatic cells of these hagfish species was isolated and digested with 
      different restriction enzymes. The DNA fragments were separated by agarose gel 
      electrophoresis. Digestion with BamHI and DraI generated two weak bands and one weak 
      band, respectively, that were estimated to be about 90, and 180 bp and about 90 bp 
      long and were limited to the germ line DNA in both types of E. okinoseanus. DNA 
      filter hybridization experiments showed that the two BamHI fragments and the one 
      DraI fragment were present almost exclusively in the germ line DNA of E. 
      okinoseanus. Thus, these DNA fragments appear to be eliminated during embryogenesis. 
      Moreover, evidence was obtained that these fragments are highly and tandemly 
      repeated. Molecular cloning and sequence analysis revealed that the BamHI fragments 
      are mainly composed of a family of closely related sequences that are 95 bp long 
      (EEEo1, for Eliminated Element of E. okinoseanus 1), and the DraI fragment is 
      composed of another family of closely related sequences that are 85 bp long (EEEo2). 
      The two DNA families account for about 19% of the total eliminated DNA in E. 
      okinoseanus type A. Fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments demonstrated that 
      the two families of DNA are located on several C-band-positive, small chromosomes 
      that are limited to germ cells in both types of E. okinoseanus.

TI  - Novel developmental bases for the evolution of hypobranchial muscles in vertebrates.
PG  - 120

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vertebrates are characterized by possession of hypobranchial muscles 
      (HBMs). Cyclostomes, or modern jawless vertebrates, possess a rudimentary and 
      superficial HBM lateral to the pharynx, whereas the HBM in jawed vertebrates is 
      internalized and anteroposteriorly specified. Precursor cells of the HBM, marked by 
      expression of Lbx1, originate from somites and undergo extensive migration before 
      becoming innervated by the hypoglossal nerve. How the complex form of HBM arose in 
      evolution is relevant to the establishment of the vertebrate body plan, but despite 
      having long been assumed to be similar to that of limb muscles, modification of 
      developmental mechanisms of HBM remains enigmatic. RESULTS: Here we characterize the 
      expression of Lbx genes in lamprey and hagfish (cyclostomes) and catshark 
      (gnathostome; jawed vertebrates). We show that the expression patterns of the single 
      cyclostome Lbx homologue, Lbx-A, do not resemble the somitic expression of mammalian 
      Lbx1. Disruption of Lbx-A revealed that LjLbx-A is required for the formation of 
      both HBM and body wall muscles, likely due to the insufficient extension of 
      precursor cells rather than to hindered muscle differentiation. Both homologues of 
      Lbx in the catshark were expressed in the somitic muscle primordia, unlike in 
      amniotes. During catshark embryogenesis, Lbx2 is expressed in the caudal HBM as well 
      as in the abdominal rectus muscle, similar to lamprey Lbx-A, whereas Lbx1 marks the 
      rostral HBM and pectoral fin muscle. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the vertebrate 
      HBM primarily emerged as a specialized somatic muscle to cover the pharynx, and the 
      anterior internalized HBM of the gnathostomes is likely a novelty added rostral to 
      the cyclostome-like HBM, for which duplication and functionalization of Lbx genes 
      would have been a prerequisite.

TI  - An immunohistochemical study of the telencephalon and the diencephalon in a Myxinoid 
      jawless fish, the Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stouti.
PG  - 140-61
AB  - The forebrain of adult hagfishes (jawless craniates, Myxinoidea) displays a unique 
      morphology. The forebrain is thick-walled and well-differentiated 
      cytoarchitecturally but lacks a well-developed ventricular system, and there is a 
      pronounced compression of the entire brain along the longitudinal axis. This 
      combination of characters obscures the boundaries between the major subdivisions of 
      the forebrain; thus, some elementary morphological issues, such as the location of 
      the pallial-subpallial and the telencephalic-diencephalic boundaries, have remained 
      a matter of dispute over the past 100 years. In an attempt to resolve some of these 
      issues, we investigated the chemoarchitecture of the forebrain of the Pacific 
      hagfish, Eptatretus stouti. Because a number of previous studies of other craniates, 
      mainly gnathostomes, have shown that the spatial distribution of some neuroactive 
      substances and enzymes mirrors the main subdivisions of the forebrain, we localized 
      acetylcholinesterase, enkephalins, substance P, tyrosine hydroxylase, and 
      alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone by means of histochemistry. Surprisingly, our 
      data show that there are very limited chemoarchitectural similarities shared by 
      hagfishes and other craniates. Some striking similarities occur in the organization 
      of the catecholaminergic systems. Hagfishes, as well as other craniates, possess 
      catecholaminergic cell groups at the ventral junction of the mesencephalon and 
      diencephalon that give rise to a catecholaminergic innervation of the basal 
      forebrain. The distribution of all other substances examined is dissimilar to that 
      found in other craniates. In particular, there are many neurons positive for 
      acetylcholinesterase in the pallium; the subpallium contains relatively small 
      amounts of neuroactive peptides; and the highest densities of structures positive 
      for neuroactive peptides and acetylcholinesterase occur in the central 
      prosencephalic nucleus. Therefore, a comparative chemoarchitectural analysis proved 
      to be of limited value in revealing homologies among cell groups of hagfishes, 
      lampreys, and gnathostomes. We conclude that some chemoarchitectural features that 
      appear to be well conserved within gnathostomes, such as the histochemical 
      differences between the pallium and subpallium, may result from evolutionary change 
      early in craniate history.

TI  - Differential proteome analysis of hagfish dental and somatic skeletal muscles.
PG  - 689-700
AB  - Hagfish, the plesiomorphic sister group of all vertebrates, are deep-sea scavengers. 
      The large musculus (m.) longitudinalis linguae (dental muscle) is a specialized 
      element of the feeding apparatus that facilitates the efficient ingestion of food. 
      In this article, we compare the protein expression in hagfish dental and somatic 
      (the m. parietalis) skeletal muscles via two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and 
      mass spectrometry in order to characterize the former muscle. Of the 500 proteins 
      screened, 24 were identified with significant differential expression between these 
      muscles. The proteins that were overexpressed in the dental muscle compared to the 
      somatic muscle were troponin C (TnC), glycogen phosphorylase, beta-enolase, 
      fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A (aldolase A), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate 
      dehydrogenase (GAPDH). In contrast, myosin light chain 1 (MLC 1) and creatine kinase 
      (CK) were over-expressed in the somatic muscle relative to the dental muscle. These 
      results suggest that these two muscles have different energy sources and contractile 
      properties and provide an initial representative map for comparative studies of 
      muscle-protein expression in low craniates.

TI  - Molecular cloning and structural characterization of the hagfish proteinase 
      inhibitor of the alpha-2-macroglobulin family.
PG  - 89-98
AB  - The "most primitive" living vertebrate the hagfish has a dimeric proteinase 
      inhibitor, a protein homologous to human alpha2-macroglobulin, in its plasma at high 
      concentration. Although the hagfish proteinase inhibitor has been isolated and its 
      function and quaternary structure studied, its primary structure, subunit 
      composition and fragmentation process remain unclear. In this study, hagfish 
      proteinase inhibitor cDNA was cloned, sequenced and cDNA-deduced amino acid sequence 
      was analyzed. A large fraction of homosubunits in the dimeric structure of the 
      protein has undergone a cleavage at a specific arginyl residue (Arg833) while the 
      rest retained their chain integrity without being processed. Thus random 
      combinations of processed and nonprocessed subunits in the dimeric structure of this 
      protein result in different molecular conformers and generate a complicated 
      multiband pattern in SDS-PAGE. It was further demonstrated by proteolytic analysis 
      that the hagfish inhibitor has no susceptible arginyl residues within its bait 
      region and thus incapable of trapping arginine specific proteinases. This implies 
      that the specific subunit cleavage at Arg833 was caused by an unknown arginine 
      specific proteinase which escaped from the entrapment by the hagfish inhibitor.

TI  - Absence of calcium paradox in the cardiac ventricle of the Atlantic hagfish (Myxine 
      glutinosa).
PG  - 181-3
AB  - Spontaneously beating strips of the cardiac ventricle of the cyclostome Myxine 
      glutinosa were characterized with respect to dependence on extracellular calcium for 
      the cardiac contractility at 8 degrees C. The force developing (Tmax) was reduced by 
      20-50% when exposed to calcium-free medium (+/- 10(-3)M EDTA) for 15-60 min. Return 
      to normal Myxine Ringer (4.5 mM Ca2+) resulted in 120-130% recovery to Tmax without 
      change in resting tension. These experiments show that the heart of this primitive 
      vertebrate, analogous to that of other poikilotherms, does not display the 
      "Ca-paradox" phenomenon. Being relatively insensitive to changes in extracellular 
      Ca2+ the Myxine myocardium differs from that in most poikilotherms in other 
      respects, e.g. in the mechanisms regulating beat to beat changes in intracellular 
      Ca2+.

      rhombencephalic divisions; the presence of a metencephalic/cerebellar division is 
      questionable. All major sensory and motor systems (with the possible exception of 
      the oculomotor system) that are typical of craniates were present in the morphotype. 
      There were extensive bilateral secondary olfactory projections to the telencephalic 
      pallium, as well as bilateral retinofugal projections to diencephalic, pretectal, 
      and tectal targets. The rhombencephalon was subdivided into dorsal (viscero- and 
      somatosensory) and ventral (branchiomotor) zones. The spinal cord projected to most 
      rhomb- and mesencephalic areas; in turn, it received descending projections from the 
      mes- and rhombencephalic reticular formation and from the octaval nuclei. The 
      reconstruction of such a morphotype depends on the recognition of characters that 
      are plesiomorphic for craniates, as determined by comparative, cladistic analysis. 
      In many cases (gross morphological, topological and cytoarchitectural characters), 
      such an analysis cannot be carried out, because characters that appear as discrete 
      entities in one taxon are lacking or difficult to delineate from other characters in 
      other taxa. The distribution of these characters in lampreys and hagfishes, and the 
      developmental mechanisms that brought them about, offer a challenging problem in 
      evolutionary neurobiology.

TI  - Immunohistochemical detection of gonadotropin-like material in the pituitary of 
      brown hagfish (Paramyxine atami) correlated with their gonadal functions and effect 
      of estrogen treatment.
PG  - 15-21
AB  - Since hagfish are members of the most primitive group of living vertebrates, studies 
      on their reproduction are indispensable for understanding phylogenetic aspects of 
      vertebrate reproductive system. Nevertheless, our knowledge of the reproductive 
      physiology of the hagfish, especially of the pituitary-gonadal axis, is almost 
      completely lacking. In the present study, the relationship between the amount of 
      immunoreactive gonadotropin (GTH)-like material in the pituitary gland and gonadal 
      conditions was examined in the brown hagfish, Paramyxine atami. First, pituitary 
      sections were stained immunohistochemically with anti-ovine LHbeta, and the degrees 
      of the accumulation of GTH-like material were compared among three different groups 
      of gonadal conditions; juveniles and adults with and without developing gonads. 
      Immunoreactive GTH-like material was heavily accumulated in adults with developing 
      gonads, whereas it was not or only weakly accumulated in juveniles or adults without 
      developing gonads. Thus, there was a strong positive correlation between the amount 
      of GTH-like material and gonadal conditions. Second, effect of estradiol benzoate on 
      GTH-like material was examined using three groups of juvenile hagfish: initial 
      control, sham control, and experimental animals. Experimental animals received 
      estradiol benzoate resolved in sesame oil intraperitoneally every third day for 1 
      month, whereas sham control animals received the same doses of sesame oil. GTH-like 
      material was heavily or moderately accumulated in most estrogen-treated animals, 
      whereas it was not or weakly accumulated in initial or sham control animals. Thus, 
      estrogen treatment in juvenile hagfish resulted in the large increase in the amount 
      of GTH-like material. From these results, it is suggested the presence of not only 
      GTH but also the hypophysial-gonadal feedback system in the hagfish.

TI  - Inner ear development in cyclostomes and evolution of the vertebrate semicircular 
      canals.
PG  - 347-350
LID - 10.1038/s41586-018-0782-y [doi]
AB  - Jawed vertebrates have inner ears with three semicircular canals, the presence of 
      which has been used as a key to understanding evolutionary relationships. 
      Ostracoderms, the jawless stem gnathostomes, had only two canals and lacked the 
      lateral canal(1-3). Lampreys, which are modern cyclostomes, are generally thought to 
      possess two semicircular canals whereas the hagfishes-which are also 
      cyclostomes-have only a single canal, which used to be regarded as a more primitive 
      trait(1,4). However, recent molecular and developmental analyses have strongly 
      supported the monophyly of cyclostomes(5-7), which has left the evolutionary 
      trajectory of the vertebrate inner ear unclear(8). Here we show the differentiation 
      of the otic vesicle of the lamprey Lethenteron camtschaticum and inshore hagfish 
      Eptatretus burgeri. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that the development 
      of the hagfish inner ear is reported. We found that canal development in the lamprey 
      starts with two depressions-which is reminiscent of the early developmental pattern 
      of the inner ear in modern gnathostomes. These cyclostome otic vesicles show a 
      pattern of expression of regulatory genes, including OTX genes, that is comparable 
      to that of gnathosomes. Although two depressions appear in the lamprey vesicle, they 
      subsequently fuse to form a single canal that is similar to that of hagfishes. 
      Complete separation of the depressions results in anterior and posterior canals in 
      gnathostomes. The single depression of the vesicle in hagfishes thus appears to be a 
      secondarily derived trait. Furthermore, the lateral canal in crown gnathostomes was 
      acquired secondarily-not by de novo acquisition of an OTX expression domain, but by 
      the evolution of a developmental program downstream of the OTX genes.

      portal triad formation.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.2535/ofaj.96.1 [doi]
AB  - The liver architecture of vertebrates can be classified into two types, the portal 
      triad type (having periportal bile ducts) and the non-portal triad type (having 
      non-periportal bile ducts). The former is detectable in the tetrapod liver whereas 
      the lungfish liver has the latter. It remains to be revealed which type of hepatic 
      architecture the coelacanth, which together with the lungfish belongs to the 
      Sarcopterygii, possesses. The present study was undertaken to determine the 
      histological characteristics of the coelacanth liver, and to compare with those of 
      other vertebrates. The coelacanth liver had periportal bile ducts and ductules as 
      detected in mammalian livers. The hepatic artery was found around large portal 
      veins. Hagfish, shark, bichir, sturgeon, bowfin and frog livers had periportal bile 
      ducts and bile ductules, whereas most intrahepatic bile ducts of the lungfish were 
      independent of the distribution of the portal veins as seen in the Otocephala and 
      Euteleostei. The lungfish liver developed duct and ductule structures in the 
      parenchyma. These data indicate that the coelacanth liver had a mammalian-type 
      hepatic architecture with a portal triad, and that the ancestors of tetrapods may 
      have had a portal triad-type liver architecture.

TI  - Highly repetitive DNA families restricted to germ cells in a Japanese hagfish 
      (Eptatretus burgeri): a hierarchical and mosaic structure in eliminated chromosomes.
PG  - 319-28
AB  - It is known that in eight hagfishes chromosome elimination occurs during early 
      embryogenesis. The eliminated chromosomes are mostly C-band positive, so that none 
      of the somatic cells have any C-band-positive chromatin. Recently, some highly 
      repetitive DNA sequences have been reported as eliminated elements in these 
      hagfishes based on molecular biological methods. However, no germline-restricted 
      repetitive DNA have been directly isolated from the Japanese hagfish Eptatretus 
      burgeri, from which approximately 21% of the total DNA is eliminated from 
      presumptive somatic cells. Through electrophoretic investigation after digestion 
      with restriction endonucleases, two DNA families that are restricted to germline DNA 
      were isolated. Molecular cloning and sequence analysis revealed that these families 
      are composed of closely related sequences of 64 and 57bp in length, respectively. 
      Southern blot hybridization revealed that the two DNA families are restricted to 
      germline DNA and were thus named EEEb1 and EEEb2, respectively. Moreover, these 
      eliminated elements were highly and tandemly repeated, and it is predicted that they 
      might amplify by saltatory replication and have evolved in a concerted manner. By 
      densitometric scanning, EEEb1 and EEEb2 were found to amount to make up 
      approximately 18.5 and 0.024% of the total germline genomic DNA, accounting for 
      88.6% of the total eliminated DNA. A fluorescence in situ hybridization experiment 
      demonstrated that EEEb1 is located on all C-band-positive chromosomes that are 
      limited to germ cells, suggesting that EEEb1 is the primary component of eliminated 
      DNA of E. burgeri.

      564 m. This account also represents the northernmost record of a hagfish in the 
      western Indian Ocean. Morphometric and meristic data are provided and compared with 
      those of 27 specimens (including the holotype) caught off Namibia and South Africa.

TI  - Comparative study of the monoamine neuron system in the spinal cord of the lamprey 
      and hagfish.
PG  - 327-36
AB  - Spinal cords of the lamprey and hagfish were fluorescence histochemically and 
      electron microscopically examined. Ventrally to the central canal of both 
      cyclostomes, yellow fluorescence bound to small to medium sized neurons was 
      observed. In the lamprey only, weakly blue-green fluorescent subependymal cells were 
      seen just beneath the central canal. In the ventral floor of their spinal cord, 
      yellow fluorescent varicosities were observed; their density was much higher in the 
      lamprey than in the hagfish. The lateral surface of the hagfish spinal cord was 
      marginated by a chain of yellow fluorescent varicosities. The yellow fluorescence 
      was microspectrofluorometrically identified as fluorescence due to 5-HT. Electron 
      microscopically, the 5-HT neurons contained many large dense-core vesicles. The 5-HT 
      varicosities or terminals seen in the ventral zone of both cyclostomes possessed the 
      large dense-core vesicles and small clear synaptic vesicles, which appeared as small 
      dense-core vesicles after KMnO4 fixation. The terminal of the lamprey was nakedly 
      situated on the ventral surface, while that of the hagfish was always covered by the 
      superficial glial layer. This finding seems to favor the view that lamprey and 
      hagfish should be divided into two different classes.

TI  - Insulin binding and internalization in hagfish red blood cells.
PG  - 258-64
AB  - Binding of porcine 125I-insulin (0.15 nM) to hagfish red blood cells was 
      time-dependent, reaching equilibrium after 1 hr at 10 degrees. The specific 
      125I-insulin binding to hagfish red blood cells was reversible, and unlabeled 
      insulin accelerated the dissociation of 125I-insulin bound to receptors from a T1/2 
      of 60 min in cells suspended in medium alone to 23 min in medium containing 8 microM 
      nonradioactive insulin. Porcine insulin and desoctapeptide insulin competed for 
      specific binding of 125I-insulin in a dose-dependent manner, whereas glucagon and 
      somatostatin did not. For porcine insulin, Scatchard analysis produced a curvilinear 
      plot, suggesting multiple affinity binding sites with high-affinity and low-affinity 
      association constants (Ka) 0.2 x 10(9) M-1 and 0.27 x 10(7) M-1, respectively. A 
      total of 2090 binding sites per hagfish red blood cell was calculated. Sixty-two 
      percent of the bound 125I-insulin was found to be internalized into the hagfish red 
      blood cells. Less degradation of 125I-insulin was observed by Sephadex G-50 
      chromatography compared to human red blood cells.

AB  - Jawless vertebrates, which occupy a unique position in chordate phylogeny, employ 
      leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-based variable lymphocyte receptors (VLR) for antigen 
      recognition. During the assembly of the VLR genes (VLRA, VLRB and VLRC), donor 
      LRR-encoding sequences are copied in a step-wise manner into the incomplete 
      germ-line genes. The assembled VLR genes are differentially expressed by discrete 
      lymphocyte lineages: VLRA- and VLRC-producing cells are T-cell like, whereas 
      VLRB-producing cells are B-cell like. VLRA(+) and VLRC(+) lymphocytes resemble the 
      two principal T-cell lineages of jawed vertebrates that express the αβ or γδ T-cell 
      receptors (TCR). Reminiscent of the interspersed nature of the TCRα/TCRδ locus in 
      jawed vertebrates, the close proximity of the VLRA and VLRC loci facilitates sharing 
      of donor LRR sequences during VLRA and VLRC assembly. Here we discuss the insight 
      these findings provide into vertebrate T- and B-cell evolution, and the alternative 
      types of anticipatory receptors they use for adaptive immunity.

TI  - Craniofacial development of hagfishes and the evolution of vertebrates.
PG  - 175-80

AB  - Cyclostomes, the living jawless vertebrates including hagfishes and lampreys, 
      represent the most basal lineage of vertebrates. Although the monophyly of 
      cyclostomes has been supported by recent molecular analyses, the phenotypic traits 
      of hagfishes, especially the lack of some vertebrate-defining features and the 
      reported endodermal origin of the adenohypophysis, have been interpreted as 
      hagfishes exhibiting a more ancestral state than those of all other vertebrates. 
      Furthermore, the adult anatomy of hagfishes cannot be compared easily with that of 
      lampreys. Here we describe the craniofacial development of a series of staged 
      hagfish embryos, which shows that their adenohypophysis arises ectodermally, 
      consistent with the molecular phylogenetic data. This finding also allowed us to 
      identify a pan-cyclostome pattern, one not shared by jawed vertebrates. Comparative 
      analyses indicated that many of the hagfish-specific traits can be explained by 
      changes secondarily introduced into the hagfish lineage. We also propose a 
      possibility that the pan-cyclostome pattern may reflect the ancestral programme for 
      the craniofacial development of all living vertebrates.

TI  - Microchemical assays of glutathione, zinc, cobalt and manganese in micro-dissected 
      areas of the endocrine pancreas in the hagfish, Myxine glutinosa.
PG  - 561-9
AB  - In hagfish islet parenchyma, consisting practically only of insulin-producing 
      B-cells and agranular B-cell precursors, the contents of glutathione (GSH) and total 
      protein-free thiols (NPSH) were determined on micro-dissected islet lobules. GSH was 
      found to be of the same order of magnitude (22-25 mg/100 g wet weight) as in the 
      islet parenchyma of a previously studied teleost fish and of some mammals, including 
      man. However, the NPSH was found to be considerably higher in the islet lobules of 
      the hagfish than in the teleostean islet parachyma. As in both teleost fish and 
      mammals, GSH made up most of the NPSH in the hagfish erythrocytes, myocardium, and 
      skeletal musculature. This discrepancy between hagfish islet parenchyma and other 
      tissues indicates that the non-GSH portion of NPSH may be of particular significance 
      for the insulin-producing B-cells. By means of flameless atomic absorption 
      spectrophotometry the contents of zinc, cobalt, and manganese were determined in 
      micro-dissected hagfish islet lobules. Neither zinc, nor cobalt, occurred in 
      significantly higher concentrations in the islet parenchyma than in the liver or the 
      skeletal musculature. Only manganese was found in somewhat higher amounts in the 
      islet lobules than in the other tissues, but the contents were still low. The 
      results indicate that none of the three heavy metals play any important role in the 
      synthesis, storage, or release of insulin in the hagfish. The significance of this 
      in relation to the prevailing hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of alloxan 
      diabetes is discussed.

      probable fossil hagfishes since the Late Carboniferous (300 Ma), but molecular clock 
      data suggest a much earlier divergence times for the two groups. In the early 20(th) 
      century, hagfishes and lampreys were generally thought to have diverged much later 
      from unknown ancestral cyclostomes, in turn derived through 'degeneracy' from some 
      Paleozoic armored jawless vertebrates, or 'ostracoderms.' However, current 
      vertebrate phylogenies suggest that most, if not all, 'ostracoderms' are in fact 
      jawless stem gnathostomes, which retain certain features that were once regarded as 
      unique to the cyclostomes, such as gill pouches or lack of horizontal semicircular 
      canal. The dorsal, median, nasohypophysial complex of osteostracans has been 
      regarded as identical and homologous to that of lampreys, but recent investigation 
      (notably on the galeaspid braincase) now suggests that this resemblance is in fact a 
      convergence. The anatomy and physiology of lampreys and hagfishes are so different 
      that it is difficult to reconstruct an ancestral morphotype of the cyclostomes, 
      assuming that they are a clade, and there is no clear evidence of any fossil taxon 
      that is neither a fossil hagfish nor a fossil lamprey, but would be more closely 
      related to the cyclostomes than to the gnathostomes. A possible exception is the 
      Silurian-Devonian euphaneropids (or 'naked anaspids').

TI  - Effects of estradiol or testosterone treatment on expression of gonadotropin subunit 
      mRNAs and proteins in the pituitary of juvenile brown hagfish, Paramyxine atami.

AB  - A single functional gonadotropin (GTH) comprising two subunits, α and β, was 
      recently identified in the pituitary of brown hagfish (Paramyxine atami). Little is 
      known about the feedback mechanisms that regulate these GTH subunits by sex steroids 
      in the hagfish. The present study was designed to examine feedback effects of 
      estradiol and testosterone on mRNA expression and protein expression of both GTHα 
      and GTHβ subunits in the pituitary of the juvenile P. atami. Intraperitoneal 
      administration of estradiol over the course of 27days resulted in substantial 
      accumulation of immunoreactive (ir)-GTHα and ir-GTHβ in the adenohypophysis, but 
      testosterone treatments over 27days had no effects on ir-GTHα or ir-GTHβ. Estradiol 
      treatment for 1, 2, 4 or 14days had no effect on GTHα mRNA levels. In contrast, 
      after 2days of estradiol treatment, GTHβ mRNA levels had increased significantly 
      from baseline, while these levels were not affected after treatment over 1, 4, or 
      14days. After 14days of testosterone treatment, both GTHα and GTHβ mRNA levels had 
      decreased significantly from baseline levels. These results indicate that estradiol 
      acted primarily to suppress the secretion of GTH, and hence resulted in the 
      accumulations of ir-GTHα and ir-GTHβ in the pituitary. On the other hand, 
      testosterone appeared to suppress both the synthesis and the secretion of GTH. Thus, 
      estradiol and testosterone probably differ in their effects on the regulation of 
      pituitary GTH synthesis and secretion in juvenile hagfish.

TI  - Hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) red cell membrane exhibits no bicarbonate permeability as 
      detected by (18)O exchange.
PG  - 1551-60
AB  - The bicarbonate permeability of the plasma membrane of intact hagfish (Myxine 
      glutinosa) red blood cells and the intracellular carbonic anhydrase activity of 
      these cells were determined by applying the (18)O exchange reaction using a special 
      mass spectrometric technique. When the macromolecular carbonic anhydrase inhibitor 
      Prontosil-Dextran was used to suppress any extracellular carbonic anhydrase 
      activity, the mean intracellular acceleration of the CO(2) hydration/HCO(3)(-) 
      dehydration reaction over the uncatalyzed reaction (referred to as intracellular 
      carbonic anhydrase activity A(i)) was 21 320+/-3000 at 10 degrees C (mean +/- s.d., 
      N=9). The mean bicarbonate permeability of the red blood cell membrane (P(HCO3)-) 
      was indistinguishable from zero. It can be concluded that CO(2) transport within 
      hagfish blood does not follow the classical scheme of CO(2) transport in vertebrate 
      blood. It is suggested that the combination of considerable intraerythrocytic 
      carbonic anhydrase activity and low P(HCO3)- may serve to enhance O(2) delivery to 
      the tissue in the exceptionally hypoxia-tolerant hagfish.

TI  - Electronic energy levels and hopping conductivity of an entire molecule of hagfish 
      insulin.
PG  - 95-105
AB  - The quantum-chemical calculation of an entire molecule of hagfish insulin was done 
      by the ENFC method in which the matrix elements were calculated at the ab initio 
      level using a minimal basis set with simulation of the aqueous solution environment. 
      The ac conductivity for hagfish insulin was also calculated at the ab initio level 
      by random walk theory. All the results were compared with those of pig insulin. It 
      is shown that the reduction of HOMOs and LUMOs localized on the active sites of 
      hagfish insulin agrees with the decrease in the biological reactivity of the 
      insulin. The analysis of primary hopping events showed that a different sequence 
      could influence the biological activity of insulin through the distribution of the 
      hopping centers and the quantities of the hopping frequencies. The curve of the 
      frequency versus ac conductivity of hagfish insulin shows that the different amino 
      acid sequences of proteins influence the hopping conductivity. However, the 
      electronic properties of native proteins are dominated by the three-dimensional 
      conformations. Finally, the electronic mechanism of trans-membrane signal transforms 
      by insulin and its receptor, which had been proposed by Ye and Ladik, was clearly 
      described.

TI  - Immunochemical evidence that the single lactate dehydrogenase of lampreys is more 
      similar to LDHB4 than to LDHA4 of hagfish.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - The tetrameric lactate dehydrogenases (LDH) of vertebrates contain several different 
      subunits that arose by gene duplication. While the A and B subunits occur in all 
      classes of gnathostomes, the enzymes of agnathans appear to represent two stages in 
      the evolution of vertebrate LDH. Lampreys of the family Petromyzontidae have a 
      single enzyme classified as LDHA4, while hagfish possess both A and B subunits which 
      form only the two homopolymers LDHA4 and LDHB4. It is generally assumed that the 
      original vertebrate LDH was an A4 type, that duplication to give the B subunit 
      occurred prior to the divergence of lampreys and hagfish, and that modern lampreys 
      subsequently lost expression of the B gene. Lactate dehydrogenases were purified 
      from representatives of all three lamprey families, and it was confirmed that 
      members of the Mordaciidae and Geotriidae also possess single tetrameric LDH enzymes 
      containing one subunit type. The kinetic properties of the lamprey LDH enzymes were 
      compared with the LDH homopolymers of hagfish, skate, and sardine. These properties 
      did not allow the lamprey enzymes to be unequivocally identified as either LDHA4 or 
      LDHB4. Immunochemical titration using antisera against lamprey and hagfish LDH 
      homopolymers demonstrated that the lamprey LDH enzymes showed greater immunochemical 
      similarity to LDHB4 than to LDHA4 of hagfish. It is concluded that there is little 
      evidence for the claim that the original vertebrate LDH was an A4 rather than B4 
      type.

TI  - A soft origin for a forceful bite: motor patterns of the feeding musculature in

PG  - 259-68

AB  - Despite lacking jaws and substantial rigid support for feeding muscles, hagfishes 
      can forcefully grasp and ingest chunks of flesh from their prey. When feeding, 
      bilaterally folding dental plates protrude from the mouth, then forcefully retract. 
      This cyclic protraction and retraction occurs in the anterior region of the hagfish 
      feeding apparatus (HFA) and involves both a cartilaginous skeleton and a complex 
      array of muscles that act as a hydrostat. We recorded motor patterns from the 
      largest muscles in the HFA in six specimens of Myxine glutinosa: the deep protractor 
      muscle (DPM), clavatus muscle (CM), perpendicularis muscle (PM), and tubulatus 
      muscle (TM). Individuals normally used four gape cycles to ingest food and four gape 
      cycles to intraorally transport food. We measured burst duration from each muscle 
      and the onsets of kinematic events and the onsets of CM, PM, and TM bursts relative 
      to the onset of the DPM. The DPM fired during protraction, while the CM, PM and TM 
      fired during retraction. Our study corroborates our anatomical predictions about DPM 
      and CM function. Activation of the circumferentially and vertically oriented fibers 
      of the TM and PM stiffens the origin of the CM, allowing it to forcefully retract 
      the dental plates. The progressive decrease in retractor muscle activity during gape 
      cycles following ingestion suggests a reliance on passive properties of the 
      musculoskeletal system for retraction.

TI  - Cartilage in the Atlantic hagfish, Myxine glutinosa.
PG  - 407-24
AB  - Light and electron microscopic observations and biochemical analysis of the lingual 
      cartilages from the Atlantic hagfish, Myxine glutinosa, reveal two different types 
      of cartilage, designated types 1 and 2, respectively. The anterior and medial 
      lingual are type 1, while the posterior lingual cartilage is type 2. Chondrocytes in 
      type 1 cartilage are similar to those found in other vertebrate cartilages. The 
      presence within the Golgi elements of material that resembles a component of the 
      extracellular matrix suggests the involvement of active chondrocytes in the 
      synthesis of the matrix. The matrix of the type 1 cartilage contains fibrils 
      arranged to form concentric lamellae in the territorial matrix and irregularly 
      arranged, branched fibrils in the interterritorial matrix. Biochemical analysis of 
      the type 1 cartilage reveals that it is composed primarily of a cyanogen bromide 
      (CNBr)-insoluble protein of unique composition that we have termed " myxinin ." 
      Myxinin appears to be similar, but not identical, to lamprin . Type 2 cartilage 
      bears no resemblance to any other known vertebrate cartilage. The principal cells 
      are hypertrophied and are characterized by masses of cytoplasmic filaments. The 
      appearance of the organelles in smaller nest cells suggests that nest cells are 
      active in the production of some of the matrix, which consists primarily of 
      collagen. Microfibrils and a basal lamina-like material are also present. 
      Biochemical analysis of the type 2 cartilage reveals that the CNBr-insoluble 
      material is different from myxinin . Comparisons of lamprey and hagfish cartilages 
      prompt the concept that these two agnathans probably followed long-independent 
      evolutionary histories.

TI  - Isolated glomeruli of the Atlantic hagfish Myxine glutinosa as an alternative in 
      vitro model to study glomerular protein metabolism in pharmaco-toxicology of 
      anticancer drugs.
PG  - 349-57
AB  - This study was designed to validate an alternative in vitro system with isolated 
      glomeruli of the Atlantic hagfish Myxine glutinosa as a model to study alterations 
      in glomerular protein metabolisms in pharmaco-toxicology of anticancer drugs. A 
      morphometric characterization of the glomeruli of Myxine glutinosa reveals a 
      calculated glomerular volume of 180 nl/glomerulus. The glomerular extracellular 
      volume, measured as inulin space, is 38.5 nl/glomerulus. Total glomerular protein 
      content of Myxine glutinosa amounts to 3.56 micrograms/glomerulus and total DNA 
      content to 0.44 microgram/glomerulus. Metabolic properties, estimated as glomerular 
      protein synthesis, are comparable with mammalian glomeruli. The glomeruli of Myxine 
      glutinosa are viable in a tissue culture for up to 12 hr. The incorporation rate of 
      radiolabeled amino acids into glomerular, acid-precipitable proteins is almost 
      identical to that of rats (e.g. Myxine glutinosa 1091 +/- 98 DPM/micrograms DNA vs. 
      rat 1340 +/- 84 DPM/micrograms DNA after 4 hr incubation). To evaluate how 
      nephrotoxic substances affect glomerular metabolism in this model, the anticancer 
      drug Adriamycin (ADR) was used to experimentally induce a glomerular lesion. ADR 
      caused an increase in glomerular protein synthesis in isolated glomeruli of Myxine 
      glutinosa, which is in accordance with data found in rats. Cisplatin, in contrast, 
      known to mainly interfere with tubular integrity, had no effect on glomerular 
      protein synthesis, confirming the specificity of the model. The isolated glomeruli 
      of Myxine glutinosa are suggested as a valid alternative multicellular in vitro 
      system for studying alterations in glomerular metabolism under 
      pharmaco-toxicological conditions and for the evaluation of specific target-cell 
      toxicity of selected nephrotoxins.

TI  - Evidence from cyclostomes for complex regionalization of the ancestral vertebrate 
      brain.
PG  - 97-100
LID - 10.1038/nature16518 [doi]
AB  - The vertebrate brain is highly complex, but its evolutionary origin remains elusive. 
      Because of the absence of certain developmental domains generally marked by the 
      expression of regulatory genes, the embryonic brain of the lamprey, a jawless 
      vertebrate, had been regarded as representing a less complex, ancestral state of the 
      vertebrate brain. Specifically, the absence of a Hedgehog- and Nkx2.1-positive 
      domain in the lamprey subpallium was thought to be similar to mouse mutants in which 
      the suppression of Nkx2-1 leads to a loss of the medial ganglionic eminence. Here we 
      show that the brain of the inshore hagfish (Eptatretus burgeri), another cyclostome 
      group, develops domains equivalent to the medial ganglionic eminence and rhombic 
      lip, resembling the gnathostome brain. Moreover, further investigation of lamprey 
      larvae revealed that these domains are also present, ruling out the possibility of 
      convergent evolution between hagfish and gnathostomes. Thus, brain regionalization 
      as seen in crown gnathostomes is not an evolutionary innovation of this group, but 
      dates back to the latest vertebrate ancestor before the divergence of cyclostomes 
      and gnathostomes more than 500 million years ago.

TI  - Acrosome reaction in spermatozoa from hagfish (Agnatha) Eptatretus burgeri and 
      Eptatretus stouti: acrosomal exocytosis and identification of filamentous actin.
PG  - 337-44
AB  - Spermatozoa of the hagfishes Eptatretus burgeri and Eptatretus stouti, caught in the 
      sea near Japan and North America, respectively, were found to undergo the acrosome 
      reaction, which resulted in the formation of an acrosomal process with a filamentous 
      core. The acrosomal region of spermatozoa of E. stouti exhibited immunofluorescent 
      labeling using an actin antibody. The midpiece also labeled with the antibody. The 
      acrosomal region showed a similar labeling pattern when sperm were probed with 
      tetramethylrhodamine isothyocyanate (TRITC)-phalloidin; the midpiece did not label. 
      Following induction of the acrosome reaction with the calcium (Ca2+) ionophore 
      ionomycin, TRITC-phalloidin labeling was more intense in the acrosomal region, 
      suggesting that the polymerization of actin occurs during formation of the acrosomal 
      process, as seen in many invertebrates. The potential for sperm to undergo acrosomal 
      exocytosis was already acquired by late spermatids. During acrosomal exocytosis, the 
      outer acrosomal membrane and the overlying plasma membrane disappeared and were 
      replaced by an array of vesicles; these resembled an early stage of the acrosome 
      reaction in spermatozoa of higher vertebrates in which no formation of an acrosomal 
      process occurs. It is phylogenetically interesting that such phenomena occur in 
      spermatozoa of hagfish, a primitive vertebrate positioning between invertebrates and 
      high vertebrates.

      which binds to the mammalian and teleost 'clearance' receptor, NPR-C), were used as 
      competing ligands. 125I-ANP binding sites were observed on both aortae and on the 
      glomeruli, neck segments and archinephric ducts of the kidney. 4.0 nmol l-1 rANP 
      competed for 50% of 125I-ANP glomerular sites. 125I-CNP did not visibly bind to any 
      of the tissues, but 300 nmol l-1 pCNP competed for 50% of 125I-ANP glomerular sites. 
      C-ANF failed to compete for 125I-ANP sites. rANP and pCNP stimulated cyclic GMP 
      production in kidney membrane preparations, but C-ANF did not, demonstrating that 
      the hagfish kidney NPR is GC-linked. This study suggests that a predominant 
      population of ANP-like receptors, similar to the mammalian NPR-A, exists in the 
      myxinoid aortae and kidney tissue. However, no detectable population of a receptor 
      that binds all NPs, such as is present in the hagfish gill, nor an NPR similar to 
      the NPR-C of higher vertebrates was discovered.

AB  - The effect of guinea pig anti-human insulin serum was studied in Pacific hagfish. 
      The metabolic indicators of insulin insufficiency, such as elevation of plasma 
      glucose, free fatty acids, and alpha-amino nitrogen levels were obtained at 72 and 
      120 hr after anti-insulin serum injection. Plasma triiodothyronine levels declined 
      significantly 24 hr after anti-insulin serum administration. These findings 
      supplement earlier data with the same species and suggest that the regulatory 
      metabolic action of insulin and thyroid hormones are related in cyclostomes.

PG  - 136-43
AB  - To investigate seasonal reproduction in Myxine glutinosa, we measured total brain 
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and determined gonadal stages of hagfish 
      collected from the Gulf of Maine once a month for 12 months. Thirty hagfish from 
      each of three different size classes of small (20-35 cm), medium (35-45 cm), and 
      large (50-60+ cm) were sampled for brains and gonads. In the medium and large class 
      hagfish there was an increase in GnRH concentrations during April and May that 
      correlated with male and female gonadal maturity. Also in these size classes of 
      female hagfish, there was a similar rise in GnRH in November and then again in 
      January that preceded the highest incidence of large eggs (stage 7). The elevated 
      GnRH may be influencing the onset of ovarian recrudescence which has been shown in 
      other vertebrates. These data suggest an association of the concentration of brain 
      GnRH with gonadal maturity and provide supportive evidence of a possible seasonal 
      reproductive cycle in M. glutinosa shown in recent studies of [J. Exp. Zool. 301A 
      (2004) 352], correlating steroid production with gonadal maturation.

AB  - Hagfishes are characterised by feeding behaviours that may include long intervals 
      between meals, and a hypoxic feeding environment inside decaying carrion. The 
      effects of feeding on metabolism (oxygen consumption rate), gut mass and morphology 
      (gut somatic index, gut epithelium mucosal thickness), and digestive function 
      (maltase and peptidase activity) were examined in the New Zealand hagfish, 
      Eptatretus cirrhatus. The influence of post-prandial hypoxia on oxygen consumption 
      rate was also investigated to replicate the immersive feeding environment. Fed 
      hagfish displayed a 1.9-fold increase in peak oxygen consumption relative to sham 
      controls. This elevation in post-prandial oxygen consumption continued for 72 h, 
      during which the energy cost of digesting the meal (specific dynamic action; SDA) 
      was 2.1 kJ. Oxygen consumption rate increased when the post-prandial environment was 
      hypoxic, a response suggesting a lack of hypoxia tolerance in this species. Feeding 
      did not alter gut somatic index (percentage of digesta-free gut mass to whole body 
      mass), but there was an increase in the mucosal thickness of the gut epithelium. 
      Maltase activity in the gut was unchanged by feeding, but the activity of gut 
      peptidases was increased significantly, consistent with a protein-based diet. These 
      data indicate that some postprandial responses of New Zealand hagfish are similar in 
      nature to those seen in other animals, but this species does not exhibit the extreme 
      post-prandial physiological and biochemical changes that are observed in other 
      intermittently-feeding vertebrates.

TI  - Immunocytochemical localization of somatostatin and vasotocin in the brain of the 
      Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stouti.
PG  - 541-50
AB  - The brain of the Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stouti, was studied 
      immunocytochemically using antisera against somatostatin (SRIH), arginine 
      vasopressin (AVP), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). SRIH-immunoreactive 
      perikarya were distributed bilaterally in the postoptic nucleus and in the 
      hypothalamic nucleus. Although several short, stained fibers were observed in the 
      vicinity of the perikarya, SRIH-immunoreactivity was not found in the 
      neurohypophysis, nor in other parts of the brain. On the other hand, presumed 
      arginine vasotocin (AVT) perikarya were distributed in an arc-shaped region 
      extending from the posterior part of the preoptic nucleus to the anterior-most end 
      of the hypothalamic nucleus and projected their fibers to the neurohypophysis. Most 
      presumptive AVT perikarya were located close to the paired prehypophysial arteries 
      near the anterior end of the postoptic nucleus. In the neurohypophysis, abundant 
      presumptive AVT-fibers terminated in the posterior dorsal wall, although some fibers 
      terminated in the anterior dorsal wall and only a few fiber endings were found in 
      the ventral wall. No ACTH-positive cells were detected in the hagfish brain or in 
      the pituitary gland.

TI  - Development of the chondrocranium in hagfishes, with special reference to the early 
      evolution of vertebrates.
PG  - 944-61
LID - 10.2108/zsj.30.944 [doi]
AB  - Recent molecular phylogenetic analyses have shown that the modern jawless 
      vertebrates, hagfishes and lampreys, are more closely related to each other than to 
      the other vertebrates, constituting a monophyletic group, the cyclostomes. In terms 
      of their developmental morphology as well, it is possible to identify an embryonic 
      pattern in hagfish embryos that is common to cyclostomes but not shared by jawed 
      vertebrate embryos. On the basis of this pan-cyclostome embryonic pattern, we 
      describe the developmental sequence of the chondrocranium and associated structures 
      in the hagfish species Eptatretus burgeri and E. atami. Our aim was to establish 
      homologies of the skeletal elements among cyclostomes by comparison of the 
      developmental patterns with a lamprey, Lethenteron reissneri, to characterize 
      further the cyclostome morphotype and its diversification in early vertebrate 
      evolution. We show that the hagfish and lamprey chondrocrania can be compared 
      perfectly at the level of modules corresponding to the craniofacial primordia 
      constituting the cyclostome morphotype. In the adult anatomy, however, there are 
      many instances in which homology cannot be established at the level of single 
      skeletal elements, mainly because of the apparently highly apomorphic nature of the 
      hagfish cranium. Even at the craniofacial modular level, the chondrocrania of 
      cyclostomes and those of jawed vertebrates display very few primary homologies and 
      are therefore very difficult to compare. We also discuss the problem of the homology 
      of a neurocranial element, the trabecula.

AB  - Optical diffraction analysis was carried out on crystalline inclusions in the rough 
      endoplasmic reticulum of the insulin and somatostatin cells in the islet organ of 
      the hagfish. A striking difference in crystalline arrangement was observed between 
      the inclusions of the insulin and somatostatin cells. The crystallographic 
      arrangement of the inclusions observed in situ in the insulin cells differed from 
      that previously found by means of X-ray diffraction analyses of hagfish insulin 
      crystals formed in vitro.

TI  - Phylogeny of enteric serotonergic neurons.
PG  - 15-28
AB  - Serotonergic neurons have previously been identified in the enteric nervous systems 
      of humans, subhuman primates, rodents, and rabbits. The distribution of enteric 
      serotonergic neurons in lower vertebrates was examined in order to determine if 
      these neurons are restricted to mammals and, if they are found more generally 
      amongst vertebrates, when they first appear in vertebrate phylogeny. Since mammalian 
      enteric serotonergic neurons take up 3H-serotonin by a highly specific mechanism, 
      the radioautographic demonstration of axonal uptake of 3H-serotonin was used as the 
      primary tool in looking for these neurons. As controls, conditions known to 
      interfere with 3H-serotonin uptake by mammalian enteric neurons were also examined. 
      These controls included incubation with 10 microM fluoxetine, a specific antagonist, 
      incubation in Na+-free medium, and incubation in the presence of a 100-fold excess 
      of nonradioactive serotonin. Radio-autographic labeling had to be absent or greatly 
      reduced under all three control conditions for labeling by 3H-serotonin to be 
      considered specific. Labeled enteric axons were found in cyclostomes (hagfish), 
      teleosts (goldfish), and amphibia (bull-frog) but not in tunicates (sea squirt; sea 
      vase) or echinoderms (sea cucumber). In addition, the serotonin concentration was 
      measured in the intestine of two vertebrates, hagfish and goldfish, that do not have 
      serotonin-containing enterochromaffin cells. Serotonin was found in both; in 
      hagfish, the amine concentration was highest in preparations of muscularis externa 
      containing the myenteric plexus. It is concluded that enteric serotonergic neurons 
      arose early in vertebrate evolution, possibly in an ancestral chordate resembling 
      amphioxus, although probably not in more primitive prevertebrates, and that they are 
      a general feature of the vertebrate bowel.

TI  - Pigmented anatomy in Carboniferous cyclostomes and the evolution of the vertebrate 
      eye.
LID - 10.1098/rspb.2016.1151 [doi]
LID - 20161151
AB  - The success of vertebrates is linked to the evolution of a camera-style eye and 
      sophisticated visual system. In the absence of useful data from fossils, scenarios 
      for evolutionary assembly of the vertebrate eye have been based necessarily on 
      evidence from development, molecular genetics and comparative anatomy in living 
      vertebrates. Unfortunately, steps in the transition from a light-sensitive 'eye 
      spot' in invertebrate chordates to an image-forming camera-style eye in jawed 
      vertebrates are constrained only by hagfish and lampreys (cyclostomes), which are 
      interpreted to reflect either an intermediate or degenerate condition. Here, we 
      report-based on evidence of size, shape, preservation mode and localized 
      occurrence-the presence of melanosomes (pigment-bearing organelles) in fossil 
      cyclostome eyes. Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry analyses reveal 
      secondary ions with a relative intensity characteristic of melanin as revealed 
      through principal components analyses. Our data support the hypotheses that extant 
      hagfish eyes are degenerate, not rudimentary, that cyclostomes are monophyletic, and 
      that the ancestral vertebrate had a functional visual system. We also demonstrate 
      integument pigmentation in fossil lampreys, opening up the exciting possibility of 
      investigating colour patterning in Palaeozoic vertebrates. The examples we report 
      add to the record of melanosome preservation in Carboniferous fossils and attest to 
      surprising durability of melanosomes and biomolecular melanin.

TI  - Presence of IGF-1-like peptides in the neuroendocrine system of the Atlantic 
      hagfish, Myxine glutinosa (Cyclostomata): evidence derived by chromatography, 
      radioimmunoassay and immunohistochemistry.
PG  - 191-6
AB  - By the use of radioimmunoassay and chromatography peptides related to insulin-like 
      growth factor 1 (IGF-1) have been identified in the cylostomian species Myxine 
      glutinosa. IGF-1-like-immunoreactivity was detected in serum as well as in brain, 
      intestine, pancreas and liver. After acid gel chromatography, the IGF-1-like 
      immunoreactivity eluted as one major peak, with an apparent molecular weight of 
      between 2-4 kDa. When the same antiserum was applied immunohistochemically, 
      IGF-1-like-immunoreactivity was observed in endocrine cells of the mucosal 
      epithelium throughout the primitive intestinal tube. These cells were of the open 
      type and occurred in small clusters. In addition, the majority of the endocrine 
      cells of the pancreas of Myxine displayed IGF-1-like-immunoreactivity. In some of 
      the specimens investigated IGF-1-like-immunoreactive perikarya and fibers were 
      observed on all levels of the brain. Distribution patterns and densities of the 
      IGF-1-like-immunoreactive structures in Myxine correlated with the measurements 
      obtained by radioimmunoassay. Absorption studies with insulin- and IGF-related 
      peptides as well as with crude extracts and the peak material obtained after gel 
      chromatography indicated that the IGF-1-like peptides in Myxine are different from 
      mammalian and non-mammalian insulins as well as from mammalian IGF-1. Generally, the 
      results suggest a long phylogenetic history of IGF-1-like peptides and indicate 
      their fundamental functional impact in all vertebrates.

TI  - Two types of antigen receptor systems in vertebrates.
PG  - 969-75
LID - 10.2108/zsj.25.969 [doi]
AB  - Extant jawless vertebrates, represented by lampreys and hagfishes, have innate 
      immune receptors with variable domains structurally resembling those of T/B-cell 
      receptors. However, they appear to lack cardinal elements of adaptive immunity 
      shared by all jawed vertebrates: major histocompatibility complex molecules and 
      T/B-cell receptors. Thus, it was widely believed that adaptive immunity is unique to 
      jawed vertebrates. Recently, this belief was overturned by the discovery of agnathan 
      antigen receptors named variable lymphocyte receptors. These receptors generate 
      diversity in their antigen-binding sites through assembling highly diverse 
      leucine-rich repeat modules. The crystal structures of hagfish variable lymphocyte 
      receptor monomers indicate that they adopt a horseshoe-shaped structure and likely 
      bind antigens through the hypervariable concave surface. Secreted variable 
      lymphocyte receptors form pentamers or tetramers of dimers and bind antigens with 
      high specificity and avidity. The fact that variable lymphocyte receptors are 
      structurally unrelated to T/B-cell receptors indicates that jawed and jawless 
      vertebrates have developed antigen receptors independently.

TI  - FMRFamide-like immunoreactivity in the brain of the Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus 
      stouti (Myxinoidea).
PG  - 443-9
AB  - The distribution of FMRFamide-like immunoreactivity was investigated in the brain of 
      a myxinoid, the Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stouti, by means of immunocytochemistry. 
      In the forebrain, labelled cell bodies occurred in the infundibular nucleus of the 
      hypothalamus and some closely adjacent nuclei. Labelled fibers formed a diffuse 
      network in the forebrain, but there was no evidence for the presence of 
      intracerebral ganglionic cells of the terminal nerve or a central projection of the 
      terminal nerve. In the hindbrain, a group of labelled cells was found in the 
      trigeminal sensory nucleus. A distinct terminal arborization occurred in the 
      ventrally adjacent nucleus A of Kusunoki and around the nuclei of the branchial 
      motor column. These findings suggest that FMRFamide may play a role in the central 
      control of branchiomotor activity.

TI  - The Central Nervous System of Jawless Vertebrates: Encephalization in Lampreys and 
      Hagfishes.
PG  - 33-47
LID - 10.1159/000455183 [doi]
AB  - Lampreys and hagfishes are the sole surviving representatives of the early agnathan 
      (jawless) stage in vertebrate evolution, which has previously been regarded as the 
      least encephalized group of all vertebrates. Very little is known, however, about 
      the extent of interspecific variation in relative brain size in these fishes, as 
      previous studies have focused on only a few species, even though lampreys exhibit a 
      variety of life history traits. While some species are parasitic as adults, with 
      varying feeding behaviors, others (nonparasitic species) do not feed after 
      completing their macrophagous freshwater larval phase. In addition, some parasitic 
      species remain in freshwater, while others undergo an anadromous migration. On the 
      basis of data for postmetamorphic individuals representing approximately 40% of all 
      lamprey species, with representatives from each of the three families, the 
      aforementioned differences in life history traits are reflected in variations in 
      relative brain size. Across all lampreys, brain mass increases with body mass with a 
      scaling factor or slope (α) of 0.35, which is less than those calculated for 
      different groups of gnathostomatous (jawed) vertebrates (α = 0.43-0.62). When 
      parasitic and nonparasitic species are analyzed separately, with phylogeny taken 
      into account, the scaling factors of both groups (parasitic α = 0.43, nonparasitic α 
      = 0.45) approach those of gnathostomes. The relative brain size in fully grown 
      adults of parasitic species is, however, less than that of the adults of 
      nonparasitic species, paralleling differences between fully grown adults and 
      recently metamorphosed individuals of anadromous species. The average degree of 
      encephalization is found in anadromous parasitic lampreys and might thus represent 
      the ancestral condition for extant lampreys. These results suggest that the degree 
      of encephalization in lampreys varies according to both life history traits and 
      phylogenetic relationships.

TI  - Acrosome reaction in spermatozoa of the hagfish Eptatretus burgeri (Agnatha).
PG  - 109-12
AB  - Fertilization of the hagfish or myxiniformes, a member of the most primitive 
      vertebrate group and an animal of phylogenic interest, is unknown. Here, induction 
      of an acrosome reaction for spermatozoa in the hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri, was 
      successfully achieved by treatment of mature spermatozoa with ionomycin and excess 
      Ca2+. The spermatozoon produced an acrosomal process that elongated from the apex of 
      the long sperm head. The reaction bears resemblance to that of invertebrate 
      spermatozoa rather than that of vertebrate spermatozoa. The result provides insights 
      into the phylogenetical changes that have occurred in this sperm reaction.

TI  - Factors affecting glomerular function in the pacific hagfish Eptatretus stouti 
      (Lockington).
PG  - 261-77
AB  - Single glomerulus filtration rate in Eptatretus stouti averaged 20.3+/-2.13 (S.E.M.) 
      nl min(-1). Single glomerulus glomerular filtration rate (GFR) could be correlated 
      with arterial pressure when arterial pressure exceeded about 4 cm H2O. Glomerular 
      filtration was affected by postglomerular resistance brought about by alteration of 
      the volume of urinary spaces. Filtration undoubtedly plays a role in glomerulus 
      function. However, average colloid osmotic pressure (COP) of the plasma is almost 
      double the average hydrostatic pressure in the segmental arteries serving the 
      glomeruli. The COP of glomerular fluid is essentially nil, therefore it is difficult 
      to see how pressure filtration alone can account for primary urine formation. When 
      single glomeruli were perfused with colloid-containing Ringer at pressures within 
      the normal range of blood pressures, GFR was within the normal range. GFR was 
      related inversely to the colloid osmotic pressure of the perfusion Ringer. Colloid 
      entered the urine during perfusion. However, in only a few instances did this result 
      in conditions favourable to pressure filtration. To assess the role of active 
      processes in glomerular filtration, chemical inhibitors were added to the perfusion 
      Ringer. Amiloride, acetazolamide, cyanide, 2-deoxy-D-glucose, iodoacetate and 
      ethacrynic acid were without marked effect on glomerular filtration. Ouabain and 
      dinitrophenol markedly reduced GFR; inhibition was probably not due to indirect 
      effects upon the renal vasculature.

TI  - Go reconfigure: how fish change shape as they swim and evolve.
PG  - 1120-39
LID - 10.1093/icb/icq066 [doi]
AB  - The bodies of fish change shape over propulsive, behavioral, developmental, and 
      evolutionary time scales, a general phenomenon that we call "reconfiguration". 
      Undulatory, postural, and form-reconfiguration can be distinguished, studied 
      independently, and examined in terms of mechanical interactions and evolutionary 
      importance. Using a combination of live, swimming fishes and digital robotic fish 
      that are autonomous and self-propelled, we examined the functional relation between 
      undulatory and postural reconfiguration in forward swimming, backward swimming, and 
      yaw turning. To probe how postural and form reconfiguration interact, the yaw 
      turning of leopard sharks was examined using morphometric and kinematic analyses. To 
      test how undulatory reconfiguration might evolve, the digital robotic fish were 
      subjected to selection for enhanced performance in a simulated ecology in which each 
      individual had to detect and move towards a food source. In addition to the general 
      issue of reconfiguration, these investigations are united by the fact that the 
      dynamics of undulatory and postural reconfigurations are predicted to be determined, 
      in part, by the structural stiffness of the fish's body. Our method defines 
      undulatory reconfiguration as the combined, point-by-point periodic motion of the 
      body, leaving postural reconfiguration as the combined deviations from undulatory 
      reconfiguration. While undulatory reconfiguration appears to be the sole or primary 
      propulsive driver, postural reconfiguration may contribute to propulsion in hagfish 
      and it is correlated with differences in forward, and backward, swimming in lamprey. 
      Form reconfigures over developmental time in leopard sharks in a manner that is 
      consistent with an allometric scaling theory in which structural stiffness of the 
      body is held constant. However, correlation of a form proxy for structural stiffness 
      of the body suggests that body stiffness may scale in order to limit maximum 
      postural reconfiguration during routine yaw turns. When structural stiffness and 
      undulatory frequency are modeled as determining the tail's undulatory wave speed, 
      both factors evolve under selection for enhanced foraging behavior in the digital 
      fish-like robots. The methods used in making these distinctions between kinds of 
      reconfiguration have broad applicability in fish biology, especially for quantifying 
      complex motor behaviors in the wild and for simulating selection on behavior that 
      leads to directional evolution of functional phenotypes.

LID - e108209
AB  - Mammals contain 1 melanopsin (Opn4) gene that is expressed in a subset of retinal 
      ganglion cells to serve as a photopigment involved in non-image-forming vision such 
      as photoentrainment of circadian rhythms. In contrast, most nonmammalian vertebrates 
      possess multiple melanopsins that are distributed in various types of retinal cells; 
      however, their functions remain unclear. We previously found that the lamprey has 
      only 1 type of mammalian-like melanopsin gene, which is similar to that observed in 
      mammals. Here we investigated the molecular properties and localization of 
      melanopsin in the lamprey and other cyclostome hagfish retinas, which contribute to 
      visual functions including image-forming vision and mainly to non-image-forming 
      vision, respectively. We isolated 1 type of mammalian-like melanopsin cDNA from the 
      eyes of each species. We showed that the recombinant lamprey melanopsin was a blue 
      light-sensitive pigment and that both the lamprey and hagfish melanopsins caused 
      light-dependent increases in calcium ion concentration in cultured cells in a manner 
      that was similar to that observed for mammalian melanopsins. We observed that 
      melanopsin was distributed in several types of retinal cells, including horizontal 
      cells and ganglion cells, in the lamprey retina, despite the existence of only 1 
      melanopsin gene in the lamprey. In contrast, melanopsin was almost specifically 
      distributed to retinal ganglion cells in the hagfish retina. Furthermore, we found 
      that the melanopsin-expressing horizontal cells connected to the 
      rhodopsin-containing short photoreceptor cells in the lamprey. Taken together, our 
      findings suggest that in cyclostomes, the global distribution of melanopsin in 
      retinal cells might not be related to the melanopsin gene number but to the extent 
      of retinal contribution to visual function.

TI  - Calcitonin-like substance in plasma of the hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri 
      (Cyclostomata).
PG  - 607-10
AB  - Cyclostomes have been regarded as having no ultimobranchial gland. However, cells 
      producing immunoreactive calcitonin (CT) were recently found in cyclostome brains. 
      In the present study, we examined using biochemical and biological methods whether 
      there is a CT-like substance in the plasma of the hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri. 
      Hagfish plasma was first subjected to reverse-phase high-performance liquid 
      chromatography (RP-HPLC) and then separated into twenty fractions. The presence of 
      immunoreactive CT in each fraction was then investigated by Western blotting with 
      salmon CT antiserum. Two fractions (36-39% CH3CN; 39-42% CH3CN) showed positive 
      immunoreactivity. Hypocalcemic and hypophosphatemic activities were detected by a 
      rat bioassay only in the former fraction (36-39% CH3CN). The molecular weight (MW) 
      of the CT-like substance in this fraction was 3.5 kDa, which is equal to that of 
      genuine CT. Furthermore, when hagfish plasma was examined by enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay using anti-salmon CT, the dilution curve of the plasma 
      paralleled the standard curve of salmon CT. The CT-like substance detected here was 
      present at a high concentration (14 ng/ml) in the plasma. From the results of the 
      present study, the CT-like substance present in hagfish plasma appears to be very 
      similar to salmon CT.

      binding in the hemoglobin system of a primitive vertebrate, the hagfish Eptatretus 
      cirrhatus.
PG  - 785-90
AB  - Hemoglobin (Hb) from the hagfish, Eptatretus cirrhatus, is composed of subunits of 
      approx. 20,000 mol. wt. Aggregation of the deoxy subunits occurred, particularly at 
      low pH and at high protein concentration. Oxygen equilibrium studies indicated 
      slight cooperativity and the presence of a small, phosphate-independent Bohr effect. 
      Equilibrium properties were protein concentration dependent indicating an 
      oxygen-linked dissociation in the millimolar concentration range. Kinetic studies 
      indicated a dimer to monomer transition in the micromolar concentration range. The 
      ligand-binding character of hagfish Hb was similar to that of lampreys, but was 
      governed by different kinetic and equilibrium parameters.

TI  - Why did the acquired immune system of vertebrates evolve?
PG  - 476-82
AB  - Rapidly expanding genomic information offers important insights into the mechanisms 
      of acquired immunity and has fostered progress in comparative immunology. However, 
      the question of why the acquired immune system, a trait restricted to jawed 
      vertebrates, evolved has rarely been addressed. Here, I will examine three unique 
      features of early vertebrate evolution, during the 50 million years when the 
      acquired immune system evolved: co-evolution with specialised parasites, increased 
      metabolic rates and genomic instability. These combine to shape a powerful 
      multi-level and multi-causal selective scenario that I propose could have moulded 
      the acquired immune system.

TI  - The vertebrate 7S K RNA separates hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) and lamprey (Lampetra 
      fluviatilis).
PG  - 456-64
AB  - 7S RNA sequences from the hagfish (Myxiniformes) and lamprey (Petromyzontiformes) 
      were cloned and analyzed. In both species, 7S L RNA (also designated SRP RNA, since 
      it represents the RNA constituent of the signal recognition particle) was clearly 
      detectable. The sequence similarity between the two species was 86%, compared with 
      about 75% similarity between either of these species and mammals. 7S K RNA was also 
      cloned from the lamprey. The similarity between the 7S K RNA of the lamprey and that 
      of mammals was 68%. Interestingly, several interspersed elements were found with 
      nearly 100% similarity compared with mammals. In contrast to the lamprey, no 7S K 
      RNA-related sequences were detectable among hagfish RNA, neither in northern blots 
      nor with the PCR assay. In view of the significant conservation between the 7S K RNA 
      of lamprey and that of mammals (human), this unexpected result clearly separates 
      lamprey and hagfish. In addition, the lack of detectable 7S K RNA sequences in an 
      outgroup, such as amphioxus, indicates that these results do not reflect an 
      autapomorphy of hagfish. Therefore, our data provide additional support to the 
      notion of a sister group relationship between Petromyzontiformes and gnathostomous 
      vertebrates to the exclusion of Myxiniformes.

TI  - The association of the subunits of component C3 of hagfish complement is unstable 
      and leads to novel degradation during electrophoresis.
PG  - 568-74
AB  - An opsonic molecule that is designated the third component of hagfish complement 
      (HC3), and a fragment of HC3 known as HC3b have recently been identified in the 
      hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri. These proteins were purified from plasma and generated 
      a set of several bands and/or smears during SDS-PAGE under standard, non-reducing 
      conditions. Two-dimensional electrophoretic analysis of the proteins under 
      non-reducing and reducing conditions revealed the breakdown of polypeptides at the 
      site of a thioester bond and the concomitant partial release of a split product, 
      depending on the weak covalent or non-covalent association of polypeptide chains, in 
      a large fraction of molecules of HC3 during SDS-PAGE. Moreover, the heterogeneity of 
      HC3b can be ascribed to the different configurations of subunits. A similar 
      phenomenon was not observed in the case of lamprey C3, even though breakdown of 
      polypeptides at a thioester bond did occur in some molecules.

TI  - Chromosome elimination in three Baltic, south Pacific and north-east Pacific hagfish 
      species.
PG  - 321-30
AB  - We have confirmed that chromosome elimination occurs in the cells of Myxine 
      glutinosa, collected from the Baltic Sea off Sweden, Eptatretus cirrhatus from the 
      south Pacific Ocean off the east coast of New Zealand, and E. stoutii from the 
      north-east Pacific Ocean off Canada, similar to cells of four Japanese hagfish 
      species. In M. Glutinosa, E. cirrhatus type A, E. cirrhatus type B and E. stoutii, 
      the differences in chromosome number between spermatogonia (44, 72, 80 and 48) and 
      somatic cells (28, 34, 34 and 34) were 16, 38, 46 and 14 respectively. The amount of 
      DNA eliminated from presumptive somatic cells averaged 43.5%, 48.7%, 54.6% and 52.8% 
      respectively. Euchromatic chromosomes and/or parts of chromosomes in addition to 
      heterochromatic chromosomes were clearly eliminated in E. cirrhatus and E. stoutii. 
      Adding our previous observations of four Japanese hagfish species, chromosome 
      elimination occurs in all seven of the hagfish species. These results suggest that 
      this phenomenon, chromosome elimination, generally occurs in the order Myxinida. In 
      addition, B-chromosomes were observed in the germ cells of E. cirrhatus and E. 
      stoutii, similar to the cells of E. okinoseanus, E. burgeri and Paramyxine atami (E. 
      atami). This fact suggests that B-chromosomes might exist generally in the family 
      Eptatretidae.

TI  - Immunological evidence for the presence of myelin-related integral proteins in the 
      CNS of hagfish and lamprey.
PG  - 869-73
AB  - Antibodies against myelin proteins were utilized in the analysis of total 
      particulate material from the brains of the agnathan hagfish and lamprey. 
      Immunoblotting revealed in both species the presence of bands at 50,000 dalton that 
      reacted with anti-bovine PNS-P0 antibodies. Single bands of 34,000 dalton and 51,000 
      dalton were immunodetected with anti-trout CNS-36K antibodies in lamprey and 
      hagfish, respectively. Antibodies against mammalian myelin basic protein (MBP) and 
      proteolipid protein (PLP) were not recognized. In spite of the lack of multilayered 
      myelin in agnatha, the presence of myelin-related integral proteins suggests that 
      agnathan glial cells have already acquired the capacity to synthesize some proteins 
      that are similar to typical myelin proteins. This represents a crucial evolutionary 
      step towards myelination.

TI  - Hemoglobins, XLVIIII. The primary structure of a monomeric hemoglobin from the 
      hagfish, Myxine glutinosa L.: evolutionary aspects and comparative studies of the 
      function with special reference to the heme linkage.
PG  - 102-8
AB  - Hagfish hemoglobin has three main components, one of which is Hb III. It is 
      monomeric and consists of 148 amino acid residues (M = 17 350). Its complete primary 
      structure, previously published, is discussed here. The proximal amino acid (F8) of 
      the heme linkage is histidine as always in the hemoglobins, but the regularly 
      expected distal histidine E7 is substituted by glutamine. This substitution, leading 
      to a new kind of heme linkage, has hitherto only been demonstrated in opossum 
      hemoglobin. It is suggested that E7, Gln, is directed out of the heme pocket, and 
      that the adjacent Ell, Ile, is directed toward the inside of the pocket, giving the 
      distal heme contact instead of histidine. Myxine Hb III has an additional tail of 9 
      amino acid residues at its N-terminal end, as has the hemoglobin of Lampetra 
      fluviatilis. The genetic codes of Myxine and Lampetra hemoglobins show 117 
      differences, in spite of many morphological resemblances between hagfish and 
      lamprey. Their primary hemoglobin structures show differences substantial enough to 
      be compatible with the divergence of the two families some 400-500 million years 
      ago.

TI  - Assemblies of linear arrays of particles in the apical plasma membrane of 
      mitochondria-rich cells in the gill epithelium of the Atlantic hagfish (Myxine 
      glutinosa).
PG  - 229-38
AB  - In the gill epithelium of the Atlantic hagfish Myxine glutinosa a mitochondria-rich 
      cell type is described which ultrastructurally resembles the chloride cells in other 
      fish species. Freeze-fracture replicas reveal different supramolecular structures in 
      the luminal plasma membrane and in the intracellular amplification (tubular system) 
      of the basolateral plasma membrane of these mitochondria-rich cells. In the luminal 
      plasma membrane ordered assemblies of particles and fibril-like elements are 
      regularly found. On the P face, the assemblies are composed of up to 20 linear 
      arrays of particles which are preferentially located in the microvillar membrane on 
      which they show a helicoidal orientation. The arrays are formed by globular 
      (diameter 8-9 nm) and rod-shaped (length 16-20 nm) particles, which occasionally are 
      so tightly end-to-end attached that they generate fibril-like structures. The 
      distances between adjacent arrays within an assembly measure 10-15 nm. On the E face 
      complementary patterns of linear grooves are present. These assemblies have not 
      previously been demonstrated in the freeze-fractured plasma membrane of branchial 
      chloride cells. In the membrane of the tubular system, emerging from the basolateral 
      plasma membrane of the mitochondria-rich cells, infrequently repeating rows of 7-8 
      nm particles are present in addition to randomly distributed globular particles 
      (diameter 7-8 nm). Complementary patterns of grooves are present on the E face. 
      These intramembranous structures resemble the repetitive elements which have been 
      previously described in the tubular system of branchial chloride cells in euryhaline 
      teleosts and the subunits of which are considered to be the sites of ion pumps.

      ultrastructural study.
PG  - 65-77
AB  - Brain capillaires and their permeability to intravenously injected horseradish 
      peroxidase, HRP, (MW: 40,000) were examined electron-microscopically in an attempt 
      to find a structural explanation for the poorly developed blood-brain barrier in the 
      hagfish, Myxine glutinosa. In particular, it was the aim of this study to examine 
      the role of the numerous endothelial vesicles and tubules in the transport of this 
      tracer between blood and brain. Many of the vesicles and tubules were found to be in 
      continuity with the luminal or abluminal surfaces, but tubules generating channels 
      through the endothelial cells were never observed. The cleft between adjacent 
      endothelial cells was obliterated by punctate junctions. HRP, which was aloowed to 
      circulate for up to 35 min, was not found in the basal lamina or in the surrounding 
      brain parenchyma. Few of the luminal vesicles and tubules were marked by the tracer. 
      In the intercellular cleft HRP was stopped by the junctions. It is concluded that 
      the hagfish like other vertebrates has a blood-brain barrier to HRP, and the 
      numerous vesicles and tubules occurring in hagfish brain endothelium are not 
      involved in the transendothelial transport of this macromolecule.

TI  - Deiodination activity in extrathyroidal tissues of the atlantic hagfish, Myxine 
      glutinosa.
PG  - 445-52
AB  - We measured low substrate (<1 nM) thyroid hormone (TH) deiodination activities in 
      liver, muscle, intestine, and brain microsomes of Atlantic hagfish fasted for 2 
      weeks and found extremely low thyroxine (T(4)) outer-ring deiodination (T(4)ORD) and 
      inner-ring deiodination (T(4)IRD) as well as 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T(3)) IRD 
      activities. T(3)ORD, 3',5'-triiodothyronine (rT(3)) ORD and rT(3)IRD activities were 
      undetectable. Hagfish deiodinating pathways resembled those of teleosts in requiring 
      a thiol cofactor (dithiothreitol, DTT) and in their inhibition by established 
      deiodinase inhibitors and by TH analogues. However, under optimal pH and DTT 
      conditions intestinal T(4)ORD activity exceeded that of liver about 10-fold. This 
      contrasts with the situation in teleosts but resembles that reported recently in 
      larval and adult lampreys, suggesting the intestine as a primary site of TH 
      deiodination in lower craniates.

AB  - Three benthic megafaunal species (i.e. sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria; pacific hagfish 
      Eptatretus stoutii and a group of juvenile crabs) were tested for diel behavioral 
      patterns at the methane hydrates site of Barkley Canyon (890 m depth), off Vancouver 
      Island (BC, Canada). Fluctuations of animal counts in linear video-transects 
      conducted with the Internet Operated Deep-Sea Crawler "Wally" in June, July and 
      December of 2013, were used as proxy of population activity rhythms. Count time 
      series and environmental parameters were analyzed under the hypothesis that the 
      environmental conditioning of activity rhythms depends on the life habits of 
      particular species (i.e. movement type and trophic level). Non-linear least squares 
      modeling of biological time series revealed significant diel periods for sablefish 
      in summer and for hagfish and crabs in December. Combined cross-correlation and 
      redundancy (RDA) analyses showed strong relationships among environmental 
      fluctuations and detected megafauna. In particular, sablefish presence during summer 
      months was related to flow magnitude, while the activity of pacific hagfish and 
      juvenile crabs in December correlated with change in chemical parameters (i.e. 
      chlorophyll and oxygen concentrations, respectively). Waveform analyses of animal 
      counts and environmental variables confirmed the phase delay during the 24 h cycle. 
      The timing of detection of sablefish occurred under low flow velocities, a possible 
      behavioral adaptation to the general hypoxic conditions. The proposed effect of 
      chlorophyll concentrations on hagfish counts highlights the potential role of 
      phytodetritus as an alternative food source for this opportunistic feeder. The 
      juvenile crabs seemed to display a cryptic behavior, possibly to avoid predation, 
      though this was suppressed when oxygen levels were at a minimum. Our results 
      highlight the potential advantages such mobile observation platforms offer in 
      multiparametric deep-sea monitoring in terms of both spatial and temporal resolution 
      and add to the vastly understudied field of diel rhythms of deep-sea megafauna.

AB  - Topography and ultrastructural organization of proprioceptors in the striated 
      parietal muscle of the hagfish, Myxine glutinosa, are described. Due to the 
      topographical location of the afferent nerve terminals four subtypes of 
      proprioceptors are distinguished. Type 1-receptor and type 2-receptor are localized 
      in an encapsulated and lamellated corpuscular organ located along and above the 
      myosepta of the parietal muscle. Type 3-receptor is composed of a complex of free en 
      plaque nerve endings within the dense collagen fibre texture at the site where 
      myoseptum, muscle fascia and body fascia fuse to a raphe. Type 4-receptor resembles 
      type 3 but it is localized in the straight collagen fibre bundles of the myoseptum 
      and the body fascia. A proprioceptive function of the nerve terminals is discussed.

TI  - A serum heterodimer from hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii) exhibits structural similarity 
      and partial sequence identity with immunoglobulin.
PG  - 1746-50
AB  - We have isolated, characterized, and partially sequenced immunoglobulin from the 
      most primitive extant nonvertebrate craniate, the hagfish, a jawless fish that may 
      have diverged from the vertebrate lineage more than 500 million years ago. The 
      160-kDa protein, which is a minor serum component, is composed of two different 
      heavy chains of 69 and 74 kDa and a light chain of 29 kDa and resembles known 
      immunoglobulin on the basis of an equimolar ratio of heavy and light chains, 
      N-linked glycosylation of heavy chains, presence of intra- and interchain disulfide 
      bonds, and polydispersity of each peptide chain. High molecular mass (polymeric) as 
      well as low molecular mass (monomeric) forms were isolated from serum. The hagfish 
      immunoglobulin is unique in that each heterodimer is composed of two different heavy 
      chains and two light chains. The partial peptide maps and amino acid compositions of 
      the two heavy chains differ; the chains do not crossreact immunologically. Slight 
      crossreactivity of the 74-kDa heavy chain with antisera against purified shark 
      immunoglobulin and some conservation of amino acid sequences, including those 
      surrounding a cysteine, suggest that the isolated protein is an immunoglobulin.

PG  - 33-6
AB  - By recording the locomotor activity rhythm of hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri, in which 
      surgical lesions of the preoptic nucleus (PON) were made, we searched for the 
      location of the circadian pacemaker in the hypothalamus. The characteristic rhythms 
      were lost in animals lacking the anterior part of the hypothalamus, which includes 
      the PON. Cuts in front of the PON did not affect the rhythm, but cuts behind the PON 
      caused the animals to loose their rhythms. Destruction of the PON with a 
      high-frequency lesion generator also caused loss of rhythms. These findings indicate 
      that the pacemaker may be located in the PON, which has retinofugal connections.

TI  - Fine structure of micropylar region during late oogenesis in eggs of the hagfish 
      Eptatretus burgeri (Agnatha).
PG  - 611-8
AB  - Using the hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri, the fine structure of formation of the 
      micropylar region in hagfish eggs during the late stages of oogenesis was 
      investigated for the first time, focusing on the bottom region of the micropyle and 
      the egg surface. During these stages, many cells penetrated through the chorion and 
      reached a pit of the egg surface, forming a shovel-like structure in two-dimensional 
      sections. The cells, which we called micropylar cells, were separated from the 
      chorion by a wall of amorphous material. In the pit, another fibrous layer filled 
      the space between the egg surface and the anterior portion of the shovel-like 
      structure. Microvilli coming from the egg surface were embedded in this layer. In 
      later stages, the stack of micropylar cells loosened, and a space appeared between 
      the anterior region of the shovel-like structure and the layer on the egg surface. 
      Microvilli decreased in length and number. The pit region appeared likely to have a 
      role in fertilization. The structures associated with the forming micropyle were 
      markedly different from those observed in the same region of teleost fishes. A 
      hypothesis that hagfish might show transitional structures in gametes from 
      protochordates to teleosts is suggested.

TI  - Observations on the development of the lateral line system in the Pacific hagfish

PG  - 257-61
AB  - We investigated the development of the lateral line system of the Pacific hagfish, 
      Eptatretus stouti, using three-dimensional reconstructions from serial sections. 
      Adult hagfishes possess a number of densely innervated skin grooves of unknown 
      function, and these grooves do not contain typical lateral line receptors (i.e. 
      neuromasts). However, three separate lateral line placodes appear to be present 
      during development and these placodes give rise to groups of neuromast primordia. 
      Unlike in other craniates, the neuromast primordia do not develop into neuromasts, 
      but they apparently transform into the skin grooves of adults.

TI  - Phenotypic heterogeneity is an evolutionarily conserved feature of the endothelium.
PG  - 613-5
AB  - Mammalian endothelial cells (ECs) display marked phenotypic heterogeneity. Little is 
      known about the evolutionary mechanisms underlying EC heterogeneity. The last common 
      ancestor of hagfish and gnathostomes was also the last common ancestor of all extant 
      vertebrates, which lived some time more than 500 million years ago. Features of ECs 
      that are shared between hagfish and gnathostomes can be inferred to have already 
      been present in this ancestral vertebrate. The goal of this study was to determine 
      whether the hagfish endothelium displays phenotypic heterogeneity. Electron 
      microscopy of the aorta, dermis, heart, and liver revealed ultrastructural 
      heterogeneity of the endothelium. Immunofluorescent studies demonstrated marked 
      differences in lectin binding between vascular beds. Intravital microscopy of the 
      dermis revealed histamine-induced adhesion of leukocytes in capillaries and 
      postcapillary venules, but no such adhesion in arterioles. Together, these data 
      suggest that structural, molecular, and functional heterogeneity of the endothelium 
      evolved as an early feature of this cell lineage.

TI  - The hemoglobin system of the hagfish Myxine glutinosa: aggregation state and 
      functional properties.
PG  - 109-15
AB  - Hemoglobin (Hb) from the hagfish Myxine glutinosa is composed of six major monomeric 
      subunits. Some of these subunits aggregate to dimers at low pH, and to tetramers 
      when deoxygenated and at high protein concentration. The aggregation is inhibited by 
      the presence of KCl. Oxygen equilibrium studies show the presence of a small Bohr 
      effect which is strongly reduced by KCl, indicating that it originates from 
      pH-dependent aggregation. ATP and DPG cause a similar decrease in the Bohr effect. 
      O2 affinity is dependent on protein concentration, temperature and presence of CO2. 
      Cooperativity is practically absent. O2 binding properties of the separated 
      aggregating and non-aggregating Hbs purified at low pH cannot account for the 
      functional properties of the composite hemolysate, suggesting the presence of other 
      subunits interactions. The results are discussed in relation to literature data for 
      other cyclostome Hbs and for M. glutinosa Hb, where the presence of three major 
      monomeric Hbs and a possible CO2-dependent aggregation had been reported.

AB  - Neurosecretory axons in the neurohypophysis of the hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri, were 
      statistically classified into six types according to the size of secretory granules. 
      Thes types are comparable with those in higher vertebrates. The concentration of 
      each axon type is different in three regions: anterior dorsal wall, posterior dorsal 
      wall, and ventral wall. The regional differences of the hagfish neurohypophysis are 
      discussed in relation to the regional differentiation of the tetrapod 
      neurohypophysis into the median eminence and the pars nervosa.

      00-00] was its highly open quaternary structure observed under an electron 
      microscope. We drew a qualitative conclusion that the high frictional ratio obtained 
      from the result of sedimentation study and the large Stokes radius obtained in gel 
      chromatographic experiment were the reflection of such an open quaternary structure. 
      In this paper I present several structural models of hagfish inhibitor based on its 
      electron micrographs and calculate expected frictional ratios for such models 
      according to the method developed by Bloomfield and his co-workers. Their method 
      allows the calculation of frictional coefficient of a body of an arbitrary shape by 
      approximating it with a collection of small spheres. To test the validity of such a 
      method, macroscopic models were built from plastic spheres or cylindrical capsules 
      and their translational frictional coefficients were measured by the free-falling 
      method under experimental conditions where the Reynolds number was between 10(-3) 
      and 10(-4).

TI  - Diversity of bile salts in fish and amphibians: evolution of a complex biochemical 
      pathway.
PG  - 308-21
LID - 10.1086/649966 [doi]
AB  - Bile salts are the major end metabolites of cholesterol and are also important in 
      lipid and protein digestion, as well as shaping of the gut microflora. Previous 
      studies had demonstrated variation of bile salt structures across vertebrate 
      species. We greatly extend prior surveys of bile salt variation in fish and 
      amphibians, particularly in analysis of the biliary bile salts of Agnatha and 
      Chondrichthyes. While there is significant structural variation of bile salts across 
      all fish orders, bile salt profiles are generally stable within orders of fish and 
      do not correlate with differences in diet. This large data set allowed us to infer 
      evolutionary changes in the bile salt synthetic pathway. The hypothesized ancestral 
      bile salt synthetic pathway, likely exemplified in extant hagfish, is simpler and 
      much shorter than the pathway of most teleost fish and terrestrial vertebrates. 
      Thus, the bile salt synthetic pathway has become longer and more complex throughout 
      vertebrate evolution. Analysis of the evolution of bile salt synthetic pathways 
      provides a rich model system for the molecular evolution of a complex biochemical 
      pathway in vertebrates.

AB  - Physical models enable researchers to systematically examine complex and dynamic 
      mechanisms of underwater locomotion in ways that would be challenging with freely 
      swimming animals. Previous research on undulatory locomotion, for example, has used 
      rectangular flexible panels that are effectively two-dimensional as proxies for the 
      propulsive surfaces of swimming fishes, but these bear little resemblance to the 
      bodies of elongate eel-like swimming animals. In this paper we use a polyurethane 
      rod (round cross-section) and bar (square cross-section) to represent the body of a 
      swimming Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii). We actuated the rod and bar in both 
      heave and pitch using a mechanical controller to generate a propulsive wave at 
      frequencies between 0.5 and 2.5 Hz. We present data on (1) how kinematic swimming 
      patterns change with driving frequency in these elongate fish-like models, (2) the 
      thrust-generating capability of these simple models, (3) how forces and work done 
      during propulsion compare between cross-sectional shapes, (4) the wake flow patterns 
      in these swimming models using particle image velocimetry. We also contrast 
      kinematic and hydrodynamic patterns produced by bar and rod models to comparable new 
      experimental data on kinematics and wake flow patterns from freely swimming hagfish. 
      Increasing the driving frequency of bar and rod models reduced trailing edge 
      amplitude and wavelength, and above 2 Hz a nodal point appeared in the kinematic 
      wave. Above 1 Hz, both the rod and bar generated net thrust, with the work per cycle 
      reaching a minimum at 1.5 Hz, and the bar always requiring more work per cycle than 
      the rod. Wake flow patterns generated by the swimming rod and bar included clearly 
      visible lateral jets, but not the caudolaterally directed flows seen in the wakes 
      from freely swimming hagfish.

TI  - A degenerate ParaHox gene cluster in a degenerate vertebrate.
PG  - 2681-6
AB  - The ParaHox genes consist of 3 homeobox gene families, Gsx, Xlox, and Cdx, all of 
      which have fundamental roles in development. Xlox (known as IPF1 or PDX1 in 
      vertebrates), for example, is crucial for development of the vertebrate pancreas and 
      is also involved in regulation of insulin expression. The invertebrate amphioxus has 
      a gene cluster containing one gene from each of the gene families, whereas in all 
      vertebrates examined to date there are additional copies resultant from ParaHox gene 
      cluster duplications at the base of the vertebrate lineage. Extant vertebrates basal 
      to bony and cartilaginous fish are central to the question of when and how these 
      multiple genes arose in the vertebrate genome. Here, we report the mapping of a 
      ParaHox gene cluster in 2 species of hagfishes. Unexpectedly, these basal 
      vertebrates have lost a functional Xlox gene from this cluster, unlike every other 
      vertebrate examined to date. Furthermore, our phylogenetic analyses suggest that 
      hagfishes may have diverged from the vertebrate lineage before the duplications, 
      which created the multiple ParaHox clusters in jawed vertebrates.

TI  - Natriuretic peptide binding sites in the brain of the Atlantic hagfish, Myxine 
      glutinosa.
PG  - 407-13
AB  - We have previously used immunohistochemistry to show that the brain of the hagfish, 
      Myxine glutinosa, contains a rich distribution of natriuretic peptide-immunoreactive 
      elements with the densest distribution occurring in the telencephalon and the 
      diencephalon. In this study, the distribution of (125)I-rat ANP and (125)I-porcine 
      CNP binding sites was determined in the brain of M. glutinosa. The binding pattern 
      of (125)I-rat ANP and (125)I-porcine CNP showed similarities; however, some 
      differences were observed in the olfactory bulb and the caudal brain regions. 
      Specific (125)I-rat ANP and (125)I-porcine CNP binding was observed in the olfactory 
      bulb, outer layers of the pallium, and in regions of the diencephalon. Very little 
      specific binding was observed in the habenula and the primordium hippocampi. In the 
      diencephalon, a distinct zone of specific (125)I-rANP binding separated a region of 
      moderate binding in the lateral regions of the diencephalon from the thalamic and 
      hypothalamic nuclei. Moderate levels of specific (125)I-rANP binding were observed 
      in the mesencephalon and medulla oblongata; little or no (125)I-porcine CNP binding 
      was observed in these regions. The data, in combination with previous 
      immunohistochemical studies, show that the natriuretic peptide system of the hagfish 
      brain is well-developed and suggest that natriuretic peptides have a long 
      evolutionary history as neurotransmitters and/or neuromodulators in the vertebrate 
      brain. J. Exp. Zool. 284:407-413, 1999.

TI  - Spread of the junction potential in the T-system in hagfish slow muscle fibres.
PG  - 50-7
AB  - The membrane constants of the slow muscle fibres from the Atlantic hagfish were 
      determined by analyzing the responses to sinusoidal currents at different 
      frequencies. The apparent low frequency membrane resistance was 20-50 komega-cm2 and 
      was not significantly altered by replacing external chloride with methyl sulphate. 
      The low frequency capacitance was 2.1-2.4 muF/cm2 and decreased to about 1 muF/cm2 
      at 100 Hz. A model of the T-system consisting of a number unbranched T-tubules was 
      fitted to the impedance locus. About 15 tubules per sarcomere with a length 
      approximately 8 times the fibre radius gave good fit to the observed impedance 
      locus. The electrical characteristics of the T-system allow an efficient 
      electrotonic spread of the junction potential through the fibre cross-section.

TI  - Identification of IGF-1 receptors in primitive vertebrates.
PG  - 73-81
AB  - This is the first report of the existence of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) 
      receptors in three representatives of lower vertebrates: the osteichtyes, 
      chondrichtyes and cyclostomi. Competitive binding studies and affinity labelling of 
      brain membranes from Cottus scorpius (sea scorpion), Raja clavata (ray) and Myxine 
      glutinosa (atlantic hagfish) identified a mammalian type 1 or IGF-1 receptor by its 
      binding specificity and the molecular size of its alpha-subunit. IGF-1 and IGF-2 are 
      almost equally potent in displacing receptor-bound 125I-IGF-1 or 125I-IGF-2, and the 
      proteins labeled with both tracers have a molecular size of 100,000-120,000 under 
      reducing conditions. There was no evidence for the presence of a mammalian type 2 or 
      IGF-2/mannose 6-phosphate receptor in brains of Cottus, Raja or Myxine. In all three 
      species the binding of 125I-IGF-1 and 125I-IGF-2 was significantly higher in brain 
      compared with liver and gastrointestinal tract, and the IGF-1 receptor could only be 
      identified with certainty in Raja liver. It is concluded that the brain of three 
      lower vertebrates express mammalian IGF-1 receptors, whereas IGF-2-mannose 
      6-phosphate receptors could not be detected.

TI  - Binding sites for atrial natriuretic peptide in the kidney and aorta of the hagfish 
      (Myxine glutinosa).
PG  - 685-8
AB  - 1. In the atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) binding sites for atrial natriuretic 
      peptide (ANP) were visualized by autoradiography in contractile structures of the 
      renal system (glomeruli, neck segment, and archinephric duct) and in the aorta. 2. 
      Since the location of binding sites is comparable to that in higher vertebrates 
      including man, these results suggest that ANP may act as a hormone already in 
      cylcostomata.

TI  - Afferent connections to the tectum mesencephali in the hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri: 
      an HRP study.
PG  - 225-36
AB  - The afferent connections to the tectum mesencephali were determined by unilateral 
      injections of HRP in the hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri, whose eyes are degenerate and 
      buried below the skin. Retrogradely labeled cells were observed ipsilaterally in the 
      hypothalamus, lateral part of the pars ventralis thalami of Jansen, and nucl. 
      reticularis mesencephali, and contralaterally in the tectum, nucl. sensorius n. V, 
      area acoustico-lateralis, and "nucl. funiculi dorsalis". Of these non-visual 
      afferents to the tectum, the trigeminal sensory nucleus contributed the greatest 
      number, which ascended along the lemniscus bulbaris after crossing in the commissura 
      ventralis. Retrogradely labeled fibers of the optic nerve could not be recognized in 
      this study, although in a previous study the superficial layer of the tectum 
      mesencephali received a few projections from the contralateral eye. These data are 
      compared with the data from other animals and previous histochemical investigations.

PG  - 539-43
AB  - In the thyroid follicles of species of cyclostomes, a hagfish and a lamprey, the 
      distribution of stable iodine was examined by electron-probe X-ray microanalysis. A 
      high concentration of stable iodine, heterogeneously distributed, was observed in 
      the follicular cells of hagfish thyroid follicles. In the lamprey a low 
      concentration of iodine was seen in the follicular lumina. The relative values for 
      stable iodine determined in this way corresponded to values obtained by a chemical 
      analytical method.

TI  - Neuronal organization of the olfactory bulb in the hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri: a 
      Golgi study.
PG  - 161-73
AB  - The neuronal organization of the olfactory bulb (OB) in the hagfish (Eptatretus 
      burgeri) was studied using the rapid Golgi method. Cytologically, two groups of 
      cells, the mitral and stellate cells, were discernible in the OB. 
      Cytoarchitecturally, the OB showed a distinct laminar structure. From the periphery 
      inward, the following four strata were distinguished: the stratum nervosum, stratum 
      glomerulosum, stratum mitrale and stratum stellatum. Olfactory fibers from the 
      olfactory epithelium reach the rostral aspect of the OB and form the stratum 
      nervosum. The olfactory fibers run deeply in the OB, enter the stratum glomerulosum 
      and terminate in the olfactory glomeruli which are arranged in three to four rows. 
      Numerous mitral and a few stellate cells are distributed in periglomerular areas. 
      The dendrites of the mitral cells terminate in one to two glomeruli in tufted 
      terminals, while those of the stellate cells are distributed in periglomerular 
      areas. The stratum mitrale also consists of mitral and stellate cells. The mitral 
      cells in this stratum extend long dendrites to 4-5 widely separated glomeruli and 
      generate axons traveling caudally. The dendrites of the stellate cells are long and 
      are distributed in the stratum glomerulosum and stratum stellatum, as well as within 
      the stratum mitrale. The stratum stellatum occupies a narrow caudal area and 
      consists mainly of stellate cells extending long dendrites to the stratum stellatum 
      and stratum mitrale.

TI  - The spread of the action potential through the T-system in hagfish twitch muscle 
      fibres.
PG  - 29-49
AB  - The input impedance of twitch muscle fibres of the Atlantic hagfish has been 
      measured with sinusoidal transmembrane currents. The apparent specific membrane 
      resistance and capacitance decreased markedly with frequency, and were relatively 
      independent of fibre diameter. A model of the T-system based on anatomical 
      observations, was used to predict the input impedance in the normal solution 
      (artificial sea water). The changes in input impedance produced by glycerol 
      treatment, low chloride solution, reduced pH and isotonic solutions with low ionic 
      strength were easily interpreted in terms of the same model. The model predicts 
      severe attenuation of the action potential if conducted electrotonically by the 
      transverse tubules towards the center of the fibre.

TI  - Structural determination of novel tetra- and hexasaccharide sequences isolated from 
      chondroitin sulfate H (oversulfated dermatan sulfate) of hagfish notochord.
PG  - 291-305
AB  - Oversulfated chondroitin sulfate H (CS-H) isolated from hagfish notochord is a 
      unique dermatan sulfate consisting mainly of IdoAalpha1-3GalNAc(4S,6S), where IdoA, 
      GalNAc, 4S and 6S represent L-iduronic acid, Nacetyl-D-galactosamine, 4-O-sulfate 
      and 6-O-sulfate, respectively. Several tetra- and hexasccharide fractions were 
      isolated from CS-H after partial digestion with bacterial chondroitinase B to 
      investigate the sequential arrangement of the IdoAalpha1-3GalNAc(4S,6S) unit in the 
      CS-H polysaccharide. A structural analysis of the isolated oligosaccharides by 
      enzymatic digestions, mass spectrometry and 1H NMR spectroscopy demonstrated that 
      the major tetrasaccharides shared the common disulfated core structure 
      delta4,5HexAalpha1-3GalNAc(4S)beta1-4IdoAalpha1-3 GalNAc (4S) with 0 approximately 3 
      additional O-sulfate groups, where delta4,5HexA represents 
      4-deoxy-alpha-L-threo-hex-4-enepyranosyluronic acid. The major hexasaccharides 
      shared the common trisulfated core structure delta4,5HexAalpha1-3 GalNAc(4S)beta1-4 
      IdoAalpha1-3 GalNAc(4S)beta1-4IdoAalpha1-3 GalNAc(4S) with 1 approximately 4 
      additional O-sulfate groups. Some extra sulfate groups in both tetra- and 
      hexasaccharides were located at the C-2 position of a delta4,5HexA or an internal 
      IdoA residue, or C-6 position of 4-O-sulfated GalNAc residues, forming the unique 
      disulfated or trisulfated disaccharide units, IdoA (2S)-GalNAc(4S), 
      IdoA-GalNAc(4S,6S) and IdoA (2S)-GalNAc(4S,6S), where 2S represents 2-O-sulfate. Of 
      the demonstrated sequences, five tetra- and four hexasaccharide sequences containing 
      these units were novel.

TI  - FMRFamide-immunoreactive structures in the brain of the brown hagfish, Paramyxine 
      atami: relationship with neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive structures.
PG  - 33-8
AB  - Localization of the molluscan cardioexcitatory tetrapeptide FMRFamide 
      (Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2) in the brain and hypophysis of the brown hagfish, Paramyxine 
      atami, was examined by immunohistochemistry specially regarding a possible 
      relationship with neuropeptide Y (NPY). FMRFamide-immunoreactive fibers were 
      demonstrated in many regions of the brain, with the highest density in the 
      diencephalon. However, no immunoreactivity was found in the hypophysis. Labeled 
      cells were chiefly located in the nucleus hypothalamicus of the diencephalon, 
      although a few cells were recognized in the ventrolateral area of the caudal 
      tegmentum. Examination of adjacent sections immunostained alternatively with 
      anti-NPY antiserum and anti-FMRFamide antiserum showed overlapping of the 
      distributional patterns of the immunoreactive structures in the brain. Moreover, the 
      same cells in the nucleus hypothalamicus were immunostained with both antisera. 
      Cross-blocking experiments showed that the FMRF-amide-immunoreactivity is abolished 
      by preabsorption of the antiserum with homologous antigen, but not eliminated 
      completely by pretreatment with appropriate antigens (NPY, avian pancreatic 
      polypeptide and methionine-enkephalin-Arg-Phe). In contrast, the 
      NPY-immunoreactivity was blocked by pretreatment of the antiserum with NPY, 
      pancreatic polypeptide or FMRFamide, although no blocking by enkephalin was 
      observed. Accordingly, the present study shows that, in the brown hagfish, 
      FMRFamide-immunoreactive structures in the brain can be recognized by anti-NPY 
      antiserum.

TI  - Evidence of a guanylyl cyclase natriuretic peptide receptor in the gills of the new 
      zealand hagfish Eptatretus cirrhatus (Class Agnatha).
PG  - 2519-28
AB  - Natriuretic peptide binding sites were examined in the gills of the hagfish 
      Eptatretus cirrhatus (Class Agnatha, subfamily Eptatretinae) using radio-ligand 
      binding techniques, molecular cloning and guanylyl cyclase assays. Iodinated rat 
      atrial natriuretic peptide ((125)I-rANP) and iodinated porcine C-type natriuretic 
      peptide ((125)I-pCNP) bound specifically to the lamellar folds and cavernous tissue 
      of E. cirrhatus gills, and 0.3 nmol l(-1) rat ANP competed for 50 % of specific 
      (125)I-rANP binding sites. Affinity cross-linking of (125)I-rANP to gill membranes 
      followed by sodium dodecylsulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a 
      single binding site of 150 kDa. In the presence of Mn(2+), 0.1 nmol l(-1) rANP 
      inhibited cGMP production, whereas 1 micromol l(-1) rANP stimulated cGMP production 
      rates. At 1 micromol l(-1), pCNP also stimulated cGMP production. The production of 
      cGMP was also measured in the presence and absence of ATP with either Mn(2+) or 
      Mg(2+). Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of hagfish gill 
      RNA, followed by cloning and sequencing of PCR products, produced a partial cDNA 
      sequence of a natriuretic peptide guanylyl cyclase receptor. The deduced amino acid 
      sequence indicated 87-91 % homology with other natriuretic peptide guanylyl cyclase 
      receptors. This study indicates the presence of a natriuretic peptide guanylyl 
      cyclase receptor in the gills of E. cirrhatus that is similar to the natriuretic 
      peptide guanylyl cyclase receptors in higher vertebrates. These observations 
      demonstrate that the coupling of natriuretic peptide receptors with guanylyl cyclase 
      has a long evolutionary history.

      study of the gill sac-muscle of the Atlantic hagfish, Myxine glutinosa.
PG  - 249-55
AB  - The intramembrane organization of the sarcolemma at the sites of myotendinous and 
      myomuscular junctions was studied in the gill sac-muscle of the Atlantic hagfish, 
      Myxine glutinosa, by using freeze-fracture replicas. At these sites rows of 
      irregularly shaped particles (diameter approximately 6 nm) and short fibrils are 
      present on the P face and a complementary pattern of grooves is present on the E 
      face of the split plasma membrane. The center-to-center distance between adjacent 
      rows of particles and grooves ranges from 12 to 20 nm. Rodlike projections being in 
      register with the rows of particles and grooves, respectively, extend from the 
      plasma membrane toward the extracellular space. These rodlike projections are also 
      recognizable in thin sections, where they appear as spinelike projections (cross 
      sections) or linear arrays (grazing sections) located in the lamina lucida of the 
      basal lamina. The intramembrane particles are considered to be integral membrane 
      proteins and to represent transmembrane links in a series of molecules by which 
      intracellular actin filaments and extracellular collagen fibrils are connected 
      across the plasma membrane. The rodlike projections are probably peripheral membrane 
      proteins possibly connecting the plasma membrane with structural components of the 
      basal lamina.

AB  - This paper revises and updates taxonomic and distributional information about 
      hagfishes (Myxinidae) from Australia. It covers five species of the genus 
      Eptatretus: Eptatretus cirrhatus known from eastern Australia and also distributed 
      around New Zealand, Eptatretus longipinnis endemic to South Australia, Eptatretus 
      strahani originally described from the Philippines and reported here as a new record 
      from Western Australia and two new species described herein as Eptatretus alastairi 
      and Eptatretus gomoni, both from Western Australia. Eptatretus alastairi is 
      distinguished from all congeners by the unique combination of the following 
      characters: six pairs of gill pouches; three-cusp multicusps on the anterior and 
      posterior rows of cusps; anterior unicusps 9-12; posterior unicusps 8-11; total 
      cusps 48-56; prebranchial pores 13-16; branchial pores 5-6; trunk pores 50-55; tail 
      pores 11-13; total pores 83-88; two bilaterally symmetrical nasal-sinus papillae in 
      the dorsal surface of the nasal sinus. Eptatretus gomoni is distinguished from all 
      congeners by the unique combination of the following characters: eight pairs of gill 
      pouches; three-cusp multicusps on the anterior and two-cusp multicusps on the 
      posterior row of cusps; anterior unicusps 10-11; posterior unicusps 9-10; total 
      cusps 50; prebranchial pores 12-13; branchial pores 7-8; trunk pores 57-58; tail 
      pores 14-15; total pores 91-93; no nasal-sinus papillae. An identification key for 
      the Australian species of Eptatretus is also provided.

TI  - Blood oxygen transport in the free-swimming hagfish, Eptatretus cirrhatus.
PG  - 43-53
AB  - Arterial and mixed venous blood were sampled through chronically implanted cannulae 
      from rested and swimming hagfish. PaO2 remained high when hagfish were swum for 15 
      min at a velocity of 20 cm s-1. PvO2 fell from 17.2 mmHg at rest to 3.5 mmHg after 
      swimming, and the arteriovenous pH difference increased from 0.15 to 0.25 pH units. 
      Whole blood oxygen equilibrium curves were essentially hyperbolic (Hill's n value = 
      1.38) and gave a half-saturation PO2 (P50) value of 12.3 mmHg at pH 7.8 and 16 
      degrees C. A CO2-Bohr factor (phi = delta logP50/delta pH) of -0.43 and a limited 
      buffering capacity of the blood, amounting to approx. 4 slykes, were observed. The 
      role of the blood in transporting oxygen and carbon dioxide both at rest and after 
      swimming is established by in vivo blood gas measurements and in vitro 
      oxygen-binding data. The low internal PvO2 at rest is close to the P50 measured 
      under similar conditions and the hyperbolic equilibrium curve permits further oxygen 
      unloading when PvO2 falls during swimming.

TI  - Substance P is a vasoactive hormone in the Atlantic hagfish Myxine glutinosa 
      (Cyclostomata).
PG  - 291-6
AB  - The in vitro effects of synthetic substance P (SP) on rings of the ventral aorta and 
      on the systemic heart of Myxine glutinosa were investigated by the use of an organ 
      bath. Increasing molar amounts (10(-16) to 10(-8) M) of SP were applied and the 
      reaction of the aortic rings was recorded with isometric transducers. SP was found 
      to contract the Myxine aorta in a dose-dependent manner starting at a threshold 
      concentration of 10(-14) M and reaching a plateau at 10(-11) M. Therefore, the 
      effective dose of SP seems to be in a physiological range. On the other hand, the 
      heart was found to be insensitive to SP even in doses as high as 10(-5) M. By means 
      of immunohistochemistry, SP-immunoreactive endocrine cells were found throughout the 
      Myxine intestine while no SP-immunoreactive nerve fibers were detected at the Myxine 
      aorta. Thus, under physiological conditions the observed contractile effect of SP on 
      the ventral aorta may be raised by SP-like material released from enteroendocrine 
      cells.

TI  - Distribution and dimension of the T-system in different muscle fiber types in the 
      atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa, L.).
PG  - 1-16
AB  - Triad density relative to sarcomeres, size of T-system tubules, sarcomere length, 
      muscle fiber diameter in native and fixed states, and size of myofibrils were 
      measured in four straited muscle fiber types in Atlantic hagfishes (Myxine 
      glutinosa, L.) of different sizes. Traids occur at A/I-injunctions in all fiber 
      types. The density of traids relative to sarcomeres is higher in "white" than in 
      "red" muscle fibers. The T-tubules show no sign of branching. The area of the 
      T-system tubules is 3-4 times the surface area in 80 mum "white" muscle fibers and 
      1-2 times that in 60 mum "red" fibers. The size of myofibrils is similar in "white", 
      "intermediate", and "red" fibers of m. parietalis, and constant through a large span 
      of animal size. In "white" fibers, increase in diameter up to 90 mum is accompanied 
      by an increase in the number of myofibrils, not by an increase in the individual 
      size of the myofibrils. Above 90 mum, "white" fibers grow by increasing the amount 
      of intermyofibrillar space. This is reflected by an extensive shrinkage of the 
      thicker "white" fibers during the preparative procedure for electron microscopy, a 
      shrinkage that is limited only by complete packing of the myofibrils. "Red" fibers 
      shrink much less.

TI  - Excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal and caudal heart muscle of the hagfish 
      Eptatretus burgeri Girard.
PG  - 3535-41
AB  - Hagfishes are regarded as the most primitive living craniates. 
      Excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling mechanisms were studied in skeletal and caudal 
      heart muscle fibres of the hagfish Eptatretus burgeri. In white (fast) skeletal 
      muscle fibres from the musculus tubulatus, force generation in response to 
      electrical stimulation was maintained in nominally Ca(2+) free artificial seawater 
      (ASW) (0Ca(2+)-ASW) containing 10 mmol l(-1) Co(2+) (a blocker of Ca(2+) currents). 
      Similarly, in red (slow) fibres from parietal muscle bathed in 0Ca(2+)-ASW 
      containing 10 mmol l(-1) Co(2+), force generation occurred in association with K(+) 
      depolarisation when the external K(+) concentration was increased to 100 mmol l(-1). 
      Therefore, external Ca(2+) is not required for muscle contraction. Hence, both white 
      and red fibres possess the function of depolarisation-induced Ca(2+)-release from 
      intracellular Ca(2+) stores. This function is the same as in the skeletal muscle of 
      all other vertebrates. In caudal heart muscle fibres, twitches in response to 
      electrical stimuli were maintained in 0Ca(2+)-ASW containing 30 mmol l(-1) Co(2+). 
      In fibres loaded with fluo-3 bathed in 0Ca(2+)-ASW containing 30 mmol l(-1) Co(2+), 
      an increase in the intracellular free Ca(2+) level associated with K(+) 
      depolarisation was observed after the external K(+) concentration was increased to 
      100 mmol l(-1). Thus E-C coupling in the caudal heart muscle is also of the 
      vertebrate skeletal muscle type.

TI  - Timing of genome duplications relative to the origin of the vertebrates: did 
      cyclostomes diverge before or after?
PG  - 47-59
LID - 10.1093/molbev/msn222 [doi]
AB  - Two rounds of whole-genome duplications are thought to have played an important role 
      in the establishment of gene repertoires in vertebrates. These events occurred 
      during chordate evolution after the split of the urochordate and cephalochordate 
      lineages but before the radiation of extant gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates). During 
      this interval, diverse agnathans (jawless fishes), including cyclostomes (hagfishes 
      and lampreys), diverged. However, there is no solid evidence for the timing of these 
      genome duplications in relation to the divergence of cyclostomes from the 
      gnathostome lineage. We conducted cDNA sequencing in diverse early vertebrates for 
      members of homeobox-containing (Dlx and ParaHox) and other gene families that would 
      serve as landmarks for genome duplications. Including these new sequences, we 
      performed a molecular phylogenetic census using the maximum likelihood method for 55 
      gene families. In most of these gene families, we detected many more gene 
      duplications before the cyclostome-gnathostome split, than after. Many of these gene 
      families (e.g., visual opsins, RAR, Notch) have multiple paralogs in conserved, 
      syntenic genomic regions that must have been generated by large-scale duplication 
      events. Taken together, this indicates that the genome duplications occurred before 
      the cyclostome-gnathostome split. We propose that the redundancy in gene repertoires 
      possessed by all vertebrates, including hagfishes and lampreys, was introduced 
      primarily by genome duplications. Apart from subsequent lineage-specific 
      modifications, these ancient genome duplication events might serve generally to 
      distinguish vertebrates from invertebrates at the genomic level.

PG  - 1322-9
AB  - Immunoreactive GH release-inhibiting factor [somatostatin (SRIF)] was detected in 
      hypothalamus, extrahypothalamic brain, pancreas, and stomach extracts of the rat, 
      pigeon, tortoise, frog, teleost (cichlid), and elasmobranch (dogfish) and in the 
      whole brain of the cyclostome (hagfish). The SRIF concentration was higher in the 
      pancreas and gastrointestinal tract than in the hypothalamus and extrahypothalamic 
      brain in most species. Extracts of the various tissues from the different species 
      assayed in serial dilutions gave displacement curves parallel to those of synthetic 
      mammalian SRIF. Cation exchange chromatography of hypothalamic extracts from the 
      various species revealed two major immunoreactive peaks, one of which correpsonds to 
      synthetic SRIF in elution volume, the other being less basic. Affinity 
      chromatography-purified immunoreactive SRIF from frog brain, pancreas, and stomach 
      extracts coeluted with synthetic SRIF in high pressure liquid chromatography. The 
      results indicate that immunoreactive SRIF in various tissues and in different 
      vertebrates is indistinguishable and suggest that there has been no change in the 
      molecule during at least 400 million yr of evolution.

PG  - 17-33
AB  - Comparison of the rate and extent of penetration of test compounds from plasma into 
      brain and muscle of the hagfish, Myxine glutinosa, indicates that the blood-brain 
      barrier is poorly developed or absent in this species. We examined a series of 
      hagfish brains in the light and electron microscope in order to relate the structure 
      of the brain to the physiology of the blood-brain barrier and cerebrospinal fluid. 
      The ventricular system consists of an ependymal cell-lined central canal extending 
      from the spinal cord to the midbrain and two or more ependymal cell-lined cavities 
      located more rostrally. A preoptic and an infundibular recess were present in the 
      diencephalons of all brains and were isolated from each other and from the primary 
      ventricular system. Since a typical choroid plexus could not be identified, this 
      suggests that cerebrospinal fluid must be formed entirely by brain in this species. 
      Cerebral capillaries differ significantly from those of other vertebrates in 
      possessing large numbers of cytoplasmic vesicles and in the relative rarity of tight 
      junctions between endothelial cells. These capillaries do not, therefore, appear to 
      be morphologically specialized for barrier functions.

TI  - Myosatellite cells associated with different muscle fibre types in the Atlantic 
      hagfish (Myxine glutinosa, L.).
PG  - 17-27
AB  - The incidence of myosatellite cells associated with "white" and "red" muscle fibres 
      of the parietal muscle and "red" fibres of the craniovelar muscle was estimated by 
      quantitative electron microscopy in the Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa, L.). 
      Myosatellite cell nuclei constitute 3, 11 and 23% of the total number of nuclei 
      inside the basal lamina of the three types of muscle fibres, respectively. However, 
      the total number of nuclei is highest in "white" fibres, most of the nuclei 
      belonging to striated muscle cells. Myosatellite cell profiles in transverse 
      sections constitute 23, 41 and 61% of the number of muscle fibre profiles of the 
      three types, respectively. The intervals between adjacent myosatellite cells are 
      approximately 135 micrometer in "white" fibres, approximately 55 micrometer in "red" 
      parietal fibres, and only approximately 25 micrometer in craniovelar fibres. Since 
      craniovelar fibres are also comparatively thin, myosatellite cells constitute a 
      significant fraction of the volume inside the basal lamina in these fibres. The 
      myosatellite cells are approximately 30-50 micrometer long and up to 5 micrometer 
      thick. Some myosatellite cells possess few organelles, whereas others appear to 
      contain many free ribosomes, granular endoplasmic reticulum, prominent Golgi 
      apparatus and lysosome-like bodies.

TI  - Copy number and sequence variation of leucine-rich repeat modules suggests distinct 
      functional constraints operating on variable lymphocyte receptors expressed by 
      agnathan T cell-like and B cell-like lymphocytes.
PG  - 403-9

AB  - Unlike jawed vertebrates that use T cell and B cell receptors for antigen 
      recognition, jawless vertebrates represented by lampreys and hagfish use variable 
      lymphocyte receptors (VLR) as antigen receptors. VLRs generate high levels of 
      diversity by assembling variable leucine-rich repeat (LRR) modules. Of the three 
      VLRs thus far identified, VLRB is expressed on B cell-like lymphocytes and functions 
      as antibodies, whereas VLRA and VLRC are expressed on T cell-like lymphocytes and 
      function as membrane-bound receptors. In the present study, we show that the copy 
      number of LRRV modules in lamprey and hagfish VLRB transcripts follows a binominal 
      distribution with the success rates of 15.5 and 22.4 %, respectively. By contrast, 
      the copy number distribution of LRRV modules in VLRA and VLRC transcripts deviates 
      from the binominal distribution mainly because transcripts with two or less LRRV 
      modules occur infrequently. Notably, the second LRRV module shows distinctive 
      sequence signatures in VLRA and VLRC, but not in VLRB transcripts. These 
      observations suggest that distinct functional constraints operate on VLRs expressed 
      by agnathan T cell-like and B cell-like lymphocytes.

TI  - Pressure-adaptive differences in lactate dehydrogenases of three hagfishes:

PG  - 477-80
LID - 10.1007/s00792-008-0140-3 [doi]
AB  - The tolerance of abyssal pressures likely depends on adaptive modifications of fish 
      proteins. However, structural modifications of proteins which allow functioning at 
      high pressure remain unclear. We compared the activities of lactate dehydrogenase 
      (LDH), an important enzyme in glycolytic reaction, in three hagfishes inhabiting 
      different depths under increased pressure. LDH in Eptatretus okinoseanus, found at a 
      depth of 1,000 m, was highly active at high pressure of 100 MPa maintaining the 
      activity at 70% of that at 0.1 MPa. In contrast, LDH activity in Paramyxine atami, 
      found at 250-400 m, decreased to 55% at 15 MPa, and that in Eptatretus burgeri, 
      found at 45-60 m, was completely absent at 5 MPa. The result suggests that subunit 
      interaction of the LDH-tetramer is more stable in E. okinoseanus than that in P. 
      atami and E. burgeri under high-pressure conditions. We found six amino acid 
      substitutions between the three LDH primary structures. Accordingly, these amino 
      acid residues are likely to contribute to the stability of the E. okinoseanus LDH 
      under high-pressure conditions.

AB  - It has become clear that the extant vertebrates are divided into three major groups, 
      that is, hagfishes, lampreys, and jawed vertebrates. Morphological and molecular 
      studies, however, have resulted in conflicting views with regard to their 
      interrelationships. To clarify the phylogenetic relationships between them, 48 
      orthologous protein-coding gene families were analyzed. Even as the analysis of 34 
      nuclear gene families supported the monophyly of cyclostomes, the analysis of 14 
      mitochondrial gene families suggested a closer relationship between lampreys and 
      gnathostomes compared to hagfishes. Lampreys were sister group of gnathostomes. The 
      results of this study supported the cyclostomes. Choice of outgroup, tree-making 
      methods, and software may affect the phylogenetic prediction, which may have caused 
      much debate over the subject. Development of new methods for tackling such problems 
      is still necessary.

AB  - This study utilised an in vitro technique to characterise absorption of two amino 
      acids across the intestinal epithelium of Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii. 
      Uptake of L-alanine and glycine conformed to Michaelis-Menten kinetics. An uptake 
      affinity (K(m); substrate concentration required to attain a 50% uptake saturation) 
      of 7.0 mM and an uptake capacity (J (max)) of 83 nmol cm(-2) h(-1) were described 
      for L-alanine. The K(m) and J(max) for glycine were 2.2 mM and 11.9 nmol cm(-2) 
      h(-1), respectively. Evidence suggested that the pathways of L-alanine and glycine 
      absorption were shared, and sodium dependent. Further analysis indicated that 
      glycine uptake was independent of luminal pH and proline, but a component of uptake 
      was significantly impaired by 100-fold excesses of threonine or asparagine. The 
      presence of a short-term (24 h) exposure to waterborne glycine, similar in nature to 
      that which may be expected to occur when feeding inside an animal carcass, had no 
      significant impact on gastrointestinal glycine uptake. This may indicate a lack of 
      cross talk between absorptive epithelia. These results are the first published data 
      to describe gastrointestinal uptake of an organic nutrient in the oldest extant 
      vertebrate and may provide potential insight into the evolution of nutrient 
      transport systems.

TI  - Different red blood cell characteristics in a primitive agnathan (M. glutinosa) and 
      a more recent teleost (O. mykiss) influence their strategies for blood CO2 
      transport.
PG  - 533-41
AB  - This study examines how the different red blood cell (rbc) characteristics in two 
      lower vertebrates, the phylogenetically primitive hagfish and a more recent teleost, 
      the rainbow trout, influence their strategies for blood CO2 transport. Deoxygenation 
      of the blood resulted in a significant increase in rbc CO2 content in hagfish, but 
      there were no significant changes in the CO2 content of plasma or whole blood under 
      these conditions. In contrast, deoxygenation increased the CO2 content of the rbc, 
      plasma and whole blood in the trout. These results demonstrate that the Haldane 
      effect is much less important for CO2 transport in the hagfish as compared to the 
      trout. The relative importance of the rbc and plasma in blood CO2 transport were 
      roughly similar in hagfish and trout and were very different from that previously 
      documented in another primitive vertebrate, the lamprey. In trout, however, the role 
      of the rbc in CO2 carriage was increased upon the addition of the beta-adrenergic 
      agonist isoproterenol (10(-5) M) to the blood. Taken together, these results and 
      those recently collected for lampreys demonstrate that changes in rbc 
      characteristics during vertebrate evolution have probably resulted in several 
      important transitions in the strategy for blood CO2 transport.

TI  - Immunocytochemical distribution of PTH immunoreactivity in vertebrate brains.
PG  - R643-7
AB  - Immunoreactive (IR) cell bodies, reacting with an antiserum specific for the 48-64 
      region of bovine parathyroid hormone (PTH), were detected in the brains of primitive 
      vertebrates (hagfish), bullfrogs, and higher vertebrates (mice). In each species the 
      IR perikarya were located in the preoptic region, although the precise location and 
      abundance of IR perikarya differed among species. Fiber tracts from these IR 
      perikarya were traced to the neurohypophysis in the hagfish but only to the median 
      eminence in the bullfrog and mouse, where the axonal terminals were in close 
      proximity to hypophyseal portal blood vessels. These results suggest that a novel 
      PTH-like peptidergic system, similar to those secreting hypophysiotropic-releasing 
      factors, is present in the vertebrate brain.

TI  - Schreiner organs: a new craniate chemosensory modality in hagfishes.
PG  - 135-63
AB  - An extensive system of sensory organs resembling taste buds was previously known in 
      the skin of hagfishes. These sensory organs, called here Schreiner organs, are found 
      throughout the epidermis of both Eptatretus stoutii and Myxine glutinosa. They are 
      found also at high densities in the prenasal sinus, nasopharyngeal duct, and 
      pharynx, and at lower densities in the oral and velar chambers. Schreiner organs are 
      multicellular aggregates composed of acetylated tubulin-immunoreactive receptor 
      cells and nonimmunoreactive cells. A considerable range of variation was found in 
      Schreiner organ morphology, but discrete classes of organs could not be recognized. 
      Schreiner organs are innervated by all sensory trigeminal rami, the 
      glossopharyngeal/vagal nerve, and cutaneous rami of spinal nerves, but not by the 
      facial nerve. The central projections of these rami form a continuous tract in the 
      trigeminal sensory zone and the dorsolateral funiculus of the spinal cord. Some 
      Schreiner organs may be represented in the nucleus of the solitary tract, but this 
      structure is certainly not the primary recipient zone of Schreiner organ afferents. 
      In light of these systemic differences between vertebrate taste systems and the 
      Schreiner organ system of hagfishes, it is concluded that Schreiner organs are not 
      homologous to taste buds. This sensory modality of hagfishes has no direct homolog 
      in vertebrates and appears to be a specialization of hagfishes, perhaps derived from 
      the primitive somatosensory system of the earliest craniates.

AB  - The formation of the scale cover in ancient fish and Agnatha was analyzed using 
      paleontology data on some forms and by studying recent species according to the 
      geochronological principle and morphological--genetic coupling approach. The 
      histogenesis of true scale cover was transformed simultaneously but independently 
      from dermal denticles, when the first process was accompanied by reinforcement of 
      the bones and formation of head-body armor and dermal-like external elements of the 
      skullcap. The scale cover is an independent organ system and is characterized by 
      self-supporting conservative ancestral mechanisms of development.

TI  - Reevaluating Emx gene phylogeny: homopolymeric amino acid tracts as a potential 
      factor obscuring orthology signals in cyclostome genes.
PG  - 78
LID - 10.1186/s12862-015-0351-z [doi]
LID - 78
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vertebrate Emx genes, retained as multiple copies, are expressed in a 
      nested pattern in the early embryonic forebrain and required for its 
      regionalization. This pattern seems to have originated in a vertebrate common 
      ancestor; however, a previous analysis, reporting two lamprey Emx genes, claimed 
      independent Emx gene duplications in both cyclostome (extant jawless fish) and 
      gnathostome (jawed vertebrate) lineages after their divergence. This scenario is 
      neither parsimonious nor consistent with the hypothesis that genome expansion 
      occurred before the cyclostome-gnathostome split, which is supported by recent 
      genome-wide analyses. RESULTS: We isolated and sequenced cDNA of two hagfish Emx 
      genes and performed intensive molecular phylogenetic analyses, including the hagfish 
      and/or lamprey Emx genes. The lamprey genes tended to attract each other in inferred 
      phylogenetic trees, an effect that tended to be relaxed on inclusion of the hagfish 
      genes. The results of these analyses suggest that cyclostome EmxB is orthologous to 
      gnathostome Emx2, which was also supported by conserved synteny. Homopolymeric amino 
      acid (HPAA) tracts represent a remarkable feature of the lamprey Emx sequences, and 
      a comparative genome-wide scan revealed that lamprey proteins exhibit a unique 
      pattern of HPAA tract accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis, including hagfish Emx 
      genes, suggests that gene duplications gave rise to Emx1, -2 and -3 before the 
      cyclostome-gnathostome split. We propose that independent HPAA tract accumulations 
      in multiple ancient duplicates, as identified in lamprey Emx gene products, may have 
      led to erroneous identification of gene duplication in the lamprey lineage. Overall, 
      our reanalysis favors the scenario that the nested Emx expression pattern in mouse 
      and lamprey shares a common origin.

TI  - Elements of the major myofibrillar binding peptide motif are present in the earliest 
      of true muscle type creatine kinases.
PG  - 785-94
AB  - Most vertebrates possess two genes for cytoplasmic creatine kinase (CK) coding for 
      muscle (M-CK) and brain (B-CK) isoforms which assemble into homo-dimeric (MM, BB) 
      and hetero-dimeric (MB) active enzymes. In mammals and birds, a significant fraction 
      of MM-CK is bound to the myofibrillar M-line where it is thought to facilitate 
      energy buffering and transport. Myofibrillar binding is mediated by major and minor 
      lysine charge clamp motifs (K104/K115 [major] and K8/K24 [minor] in chicken M-CK) 
      located in the N-terminal region [J. Cell Biol. 149 (2000) 1225]. We have obtained 
      the cDNA and deduced amino acid sequences for cytoplasmic CKs from two hagfish, 
      Myxine glutinosa and Eptatretus stoutii, non-vertebrate craniates, and the sequences 
      for two cytoplasmic CKs from the lamprey Lampetra japonica, a jawless true 
      vertebrate. All four cDNAs code for CKs consisting of approximately 380 residues. 
      Phylogenetic analyses showed that the hagfish and lamprey CKs are coded for by genes 
      which are clearly muscle type (M) creatine kinases. Two of these four M-CKs have the 
      K104/K115-equivalent residues of the major myofibrillar binding region while the 
      other two have the K115 equivalent but lack the corresponding K104 residue. All four 
      M-CKs lack the K8/K24 equivalent elements of the minor myofibrillar binding region. 
      Comparison of these sequences to corresponding sequences of cytoplasmic CKs from two 
      protochordates (tunicate, amphioxus) and M- and B-CKs from true fish and above 
      reveal a pattern of acquisition (and loss) of key lysine residues consistent with 
      the physiological context in which these enzymes operate.

TI  - Evolutionary implications of lactate dehydrogenases (LDHs) of hagfishes compared to 
      lampreys: LDH cDNA sequences from Eptatretus burgeri, Paramyxine atami and 
      Eptatretus okinoseanus.
PG  - 475-9
LID - 10.2108/zsj.25.475 [doi]
AB  - Heart muscles of hagfishes Paramyxine atami and Eptatretus okinoseanus express the 
      B4 isozyme of lactate dehydrogenase [L-LDH: NAD oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.27] 
      (LDH-B4) whereas their skeletal muscles express LDH-A4. To examine the relationship 
      of hagfish LDHs to lamprey and other vertebrate LDHs, we determined the cDNA 
      sequences of LDH-A from three hagfishes and compared them with previously published 
      sequences. A phylogenic tree shows that hagfishes diverged just after lampreys. The 
      deduced amino acid sequences showed ten regions common to all vertebrate LDHs 
      examined, i.e., the active site, the pocket recognizing the substrate-coenzyme 
      complex, part of a loop at the surface, and the substrate binding site. The 
      cyclostomate-specific regions (S1, S2) were located in the neighborhood of the 
      active site loop. Three regions, IGS1, IGS2 and IGS3, seem to have altered their 
      structures during the differentiation of LDH isozymes, and the regions remain in 
      LDH-B of vertebrates hitherto examined. IGS2 and IGS3, which are in the neighborhood 
      of the active site, may regulate catalytic activity. There were differences in six 
      amino acid residues (6, 10, 20, 156, 269, and 341) in LDHs of hagfishes. These 
      differences might reflect the tolerance to high pressure and low temperature of LDHs 
      from hagfishes at different habitat depths.

AB  - A new species of Acanthochondria Oakley, 1927 (Copepoda, Poecilostomatoida, 
      Chondracanthidae), parasitic in the pharynx of hagfishes Eptatretus burgeri 
      (Girard), E. sheni (Kuo, Huang & Mok) and E. yangi (Teng), from off Taiwan is 
      described and illustrated. The new species can be distinguished from its congeners 
      by having the neck region longer than wide (about 2-3 times as long as wide), the 
      moderately long protopod of leg 2 (Type E), the endopod of leg 2 as large as exopod, 
      the cephalosome wider than long, the armature formula of antennule (1, 1, 2, 2, 9), 
      the relatively long trunk (6.7 mm) and egg-sacs (14.4 mm). This is the first record 
      of a parasitic chondracanthid from hagfishes. The findings may provide insights into 
      the phylogenetic relationships and interactions among chondracanthids, hagfishes and 
      demersal fishes, but call for further molecular studies.

TI  - Projections ascending from the spinal cord to the brain in petromyzontid and 
      myxinoid agnathans.
PG  - 491-508
AB  - The course of projections ascending through the rostral spinal cord to nuclei in the 
      brains of petromyzontid and myxinoid agnathans was examined with silver staining of 
      anterograde degeneration and horseradish peroxidase histochemistry. As in jawed 
      vertebrates, the ascending spinal projections of lampreys and hagfishes appear to be 
      organized into two major systems, the spinal lemniscal and dorsal column pathways. 
      The spinal lemniscal pathway, extending rostrally along the ventrolateral margin of 
      the spinal and medullary central gray, consists of a spinoreticular and possibly a 
      spinovestibular projection in both aganthan groups. In Pacific hagfish, spinal 
      lemniscal fibers reach the ipsilateral mesencephalic tectum, but no spinal 
      projection to the thalamus was evident. The spinal lemniscus of lampreys ascends to 
      the region of the isthmus and may extend into the mesencephalic tegmentum. 
      Anterograde and retrograde tracing methods indicate that a very small population of 
      cells in the far rostral cord of lampreys may project to the optic tectum and 
      diencephalon; however, spinotectal and spinothalamic projections, if present, are 
      limited in extent. The dorsal column pathway in agnathans, consisting in part of 
      primary spinal afferents, ascends in the dorsal funiculus of the cord. The dorsal 
      column fibers of agnathans, like those of some other anamniotes, continue beyond the 
      spinomedullary junction through the length of the hindbrain, possibly conveying 
      ascending somatosensory input to the sensory nuclei of the alar medulla.

TI  - Hypoxic vasoconstriction of cyclostome systemic vessels: the antecedent of hypoxic 
      pulmonary vasoconstriction?
PG  - R198-206
AB  - Hypoxic vasoconstriction (HV) is an intrinsic response of mammalian pulmonary 
      vascular smooth muscle (VSM). In the present study, HV was examined by myography of 
      vessel rings from three primitive vertebrates: New Zealand hagfish (NZH), Pacific 
      hagfish (PH), and sea lamprey (SL). Hypoxia dilated pre-gill arteries (ventral 
      aorta, afferent branchial) from all species, whereas it contracted systemic arteries 
      [dorsal aorta (DA), efferent branchial, celiacomesenteric]. DA HV was reproducible 
      over several days, and it could be sustained in NZH for 8 h without adverse effects. 
      Tension was proportional to PO(2), and half-maximal HV was obtained at PO(2) (mmHg) 
      of 4.7 +/- 0. 2 (NZH), 0.8 +/- 0.1 (PH), and 10.7 +/- 1.9 (SL). HV did not require 
      preconditioning (preexisting contractile stimulus) and was unaffected by elevated 
      extracellular potassium (200 mM NZH; 80 mM SL); removal of the endothelium (NZH); or 
      inhibitors of cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, cytochrome P-450 or antagonists of 
      alpha-adrenergic, muscarinic, nicotinic, purinergic, or serotoninergic receptors. 
      These results show that HV is an intrinsic feature of systemic VSM in cyclostomes 
      and suggest that HV has been in the repertoire of VSM responses, since the origin of 
      vertebrates. The exceptionally hardy HV in cyclostome DA may provide a useful model 
      with which to examine both the phylogeny and mechanisms of this response.

AB  - Buffer solutions of commercially available batches of the electron microscopic 
      enzyme tracers, horseradish peroxidase (HRP, mol wt = 40,000) and microperoxidase 
      (MP, mol wt = 2,000), were investigated by gel filtration. The elution profiles of 
      the HRP and MP solutions together with estimates of the peroxidatic activity of the 
      collected fractions indicated that HRP was homogeneous with respect to molecular 
      weight, while MP contained high molecular weight impurities with peroxidatic 
      activity. Serum samples from four different species of tracer-injected animals 
      (hagfish, lamprey, frog, mouse) and from control animals were investigated with the 
      same techniques. No binding between HRP and the serum proteins or degradation of HRP 
      was detected; whereas, MP circulated predominantly bound to serum proteins in all 
      the investigated animals. The number average molecular weights of aqueous solutions 
      of HRP and MP determined by vapor osmometry were 9,000 and 1,000, respectively. The 
      results emphasize that protein binding should be evaluated when MP is used as an 
      electron microscopic tracer. In addition, the finding that HRP and MP solutions have 
      a much higher osmotic activity than the molecular weights of the tracers would 
      suggest should be taken into consideration, especially when bolus injections into 
      animals are performed.

TI  - Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) of jawed and jawless fishes: 
      implications for its evolutionary origin.
PG  - 401-12
AB  - The macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a cytokine produced by T 
      lymphocytes and macrophages in response to inflammatory stimuli. We sequenced MIF 
      cDNA clones of two jawless fishes, the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) and the 
      North Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa), as well as of the jawed (cichlid) fish 
      Paralabidochromis chilotes. The fish MIF-encoding genes have the same exon-intron 
      organization as the mammalian MIF genes and are present in one copy per haploid 
      genome. Secondary and tertiary structure predictions suggest that the fish MIF 
      proteins have a topology characteristic of the entire MIF-family of proteins. 
      Phylogenetic analysis separates the known nematode members of the family into two 
      groups, one having a sister group relationship with the mammalian D-dopachrome 
      tautomerase (DDT) proteins and the other being related to vertebrate MIFs. It also 
      reveals a high degree of convergent evolution among the members of the family. 
      Finally, it suggests that the divergence of MIF and DDT occurred before the 
      emergence of nematodes in metazoan evolution.

TI  - Molecular phylogeny of early vertebrates: monophyly of the agnathans as revealed by 
      sequences of 35 genes.
PG  - 287-92
AB  - Extant vertebrates are divided into three major groups: hagfishes (Hyperotreti, 
      myxinoids), lampreys (Hyperoartia, petromyzontids), and jawed vertebrates 
      (Gnathostomata). The phylogenetic relationships among the groups and within the 
      jawed vertebrates are controversial, for both morphological and molecular studies 
      have rendered themselves to conflicting interpretations. Here, we use the sequences 
      of 35 nuclear protein-encoding genes to provide definitive evidence for the 
      monophyly of the Agnatha (jawless vertebrates, a group encompassing the hagfishes 
      and lampreys). Our analyses also give a strong support for the separation of 
      Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fishes) before the divergence of Osteichthyes (bony 
      fishes) from the other gnathostomes.

TI  - Ikaros family members from the agnathan Myxine glutinosa and the urochordate 
      Oikopleura dioica: emergence of an essential transcription factor for adaptive 
      immunity.
PG  - 6006-13
AB  - The Ikaros multigene family encodes a number of zinc finger transcription factors 
      that play key roles in vertebrate hemopoietic stem cell differentiation and the 
      generation of B, T, and NK cell lineages. In this study, we describe the 
      identification and characterization of an Ikaros family-like (IFL) protein from the 
      agnathan hagfish Myxine glutinosa and the marine urochordate Oikopleura dioica, both 
      of which lie on the evolutionary boundary between the vertebrates and invertebrates. 
      The IFL molecules identified in these animals displayed high conservation in the 
      zinc finger motifs critical for DNA binding and dimerization in comparison with 
      those of jawed vertebrates. Expression of the IFL gene in hagfish was strongest in 
      blood, intestine, and gills. In O. dioica, transcription from the IFL gene was 
      initiated at or around the time of hatching and maintained throughout the life span 
      of the animal. In situ hybridization localized O. dioica IFL expression to the Fol 
      cells, which are responsible for generating the food filter of the house. 
      Biochemical analysis of the DNA binding and dimerization domains from M. glutinosa 
      and O. dioici IFLs showed that M. glutinosa behaves as a true Ikaros family member. 
      Taken together, these results indicate that the properties associated with the 
      Ikaros family preceded the emergence of the jawed vertebrates and thus adaptive 
      immunity.

TI  - Primary neurons of the lateral line nerves and their central projections in 
      hagfishes.
PG  - 303-10
AB  - The hagfish lateral line system was studied by horseradish peroxidase 
      transganglionic transport. The anterior lateral line nerve innervates the group of 
      lateral line canals situated anteriorly to the eye, and the posterior lateral line 
      nerve innervates the group of canals situated posteriorly to the eye. Although both 
      nerves pass through the muscle fascia at the same point, each runs a different 
      course to the brain. The anterior lateral line nerve runs near the trigeminal nerve 
      and its ganglion is closely attached to the trigeminal ganglion, but both systems 
      are completely independent. The posterior lateral line nerve runs independently of 
      any other cranial nerve and makes a peculiar U-turn at the point of entry to the 
      brain capsule. The anterior lateral line ganglion contains both cutaneous sensory 
      cells (small to large cells) and lateral line sensory cells (small cells); from this 
      ganglion projections run to both the trigeminal sensory nucleus (fine and thick 
      fibers) and medial nucleus of the area acousticolateralis (fine fibers). The 
      posterior lateral line ganglion contains only small lateral line cells that project 
      fine fibers to the medial nucleus of the area acousticolateralis. There are no 
      efferent components in this lateral line system, and its only afferent terminal 
      field is the medial nucleus of the area acousticolateralis.

AB  - Unfractionated peripheral blood leucocytes from allogeneic hagfish proliferated 
      vigorously in one-way mixed leucocyte reaction (MLR) at 20-22 degrees. Maximum 
      responsiveness was observed after 5 days of co-culture of responder and irradiated 
      stimulator cells. Separation of leucocytes on the basis of laser scatter parameters 
      yielded a small leucocyte population which responded but did not stimulate in MLR 
      and a large leucocyte population capable of stimulating but not responding. Adherent 
      cell depletion of the total leucocyte population did not affect the ability to 
      respond in MLR but did ablate the stimulatory capacity of hagfish leucocytes. 
      Together with previous phenotypic studies, these results confirm the presence of 
      lymphocyte and macrophage/accessory cell populations in hagfish peripheral 
      leucocytes.

TI  - A germline restricted, highly repetitive DNA sequence in Paramyxine atami: an 
      interspecifically conserved, but somatically eliminated, element.
PG  - 252-6
AB  - In some species of hagfish, the phenomenon of chromosome elimination occurs during 
      embryogenesis. However, only two repetitive DNA families are known to be represented 
      in chromosomes that are eliminated from somatic cells of the Japanese hagfish 
      Eptatretus okinoseanus. Using molecular analyses, another germ line-restricted, 
      highly repetitive DNA family has been detected in another Japanese hagfish, 
      Paramyxine atami. The repeat unit of this family, which is 83 bp long, has been 
      designated "EEPa1", for Eliminated Element of P. atami 1. DNA filter hybridization 
      using EEPa1 as a probe revealed that this family is shared among several species and 
      is conserved in the germline DNA. Although eliminated, repetitive DNA that is shared 
      interspecifically has not been reported in hagfish species, cases of chromatin 
      diminution and chromosome elimination processes have been described previously in 
      other organisms. The patterns and intensities of hybridization signals suggest that 
      members of the repetitive DNA family defined by EEPa1 have undergone concerted 
      molecular evolution.

TI  - 28S and 18S rDNA sequences support the monophyly of lampreys and hagfishes.
PG  - 1706-18
AB  - Resolving the interrelationships of three major extant lineages of vertebrates 
      (hagfishes, lampreys, and gnathostomes) is a particularly important issue in 
      evolution, because the basal resolution critically influences our understanding of 
      primitive vertebrate characters. A consensus has emerged over the last 20 years that 
      lampreys are the sister group to the gnathostomes and the hagfishes represent an 
      ancient, basal lineage. This hypothesis has essentially displaced the classical 
      hypothesis of monophyly of the cyclostomes (lampreys plus hagfishes). To test these 
      hypotheses, we compared nearly complete ribosomal DNA sequences from each of these 
      major lineages, as well as those from a cephalochordate and a urochordate, which 
      represent a paraphyletic outgroup for assessing the basal vertebrate relationships. 
      For this comparison, 92%-99% complete 28S rDNA sequences were obtained from the 
      lancelet Branchiostoma floridae, the hagfish Eptatretus stouti, the lamprey 
      Petromyzon marinus, and cartilaginous fishes Hydrolagus colliei and Squalus 
      acanthias and were then analyzed with previously reported 28S and 18S rDNA sequences 
      from other chordates. We conducted conventional (nonparametric) bootstrap analyses, 
      under maximum-likelihood, parsimony, and minimum-evolution (using LogDet distances) 
      criteria, of both 28S and 18S rDNA sequences considered separately and combined. All 
      these analyses provide moderate to very strong support for the monophyly of the 
      cyclostomes. Furthermore, the currently accepted hypothesis of a lamprey-gnathostome 
      clade is moderately rejected by the Kishino-Hasegawa test (P = 0.099) and 
      resoundingly rejected by parametric bootstrap tests (P < 0.01) in favor of monophyly 
      of living cyclostomes. Another significant finding is that the hagfish E. stouti has 
      the longest 28S rDNA gene known in any organism (> 5,200 nt).

TI  - A new family member for gonadotropin-releasing hormone.
PG  - 205-14
AB  - The two living representatives of the most ancient vertebrates, Agnathans, are 
      lamprey and hagfish. Using immunological methods, we identified 
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-like molecules in the lamprey brain, but not 
      hagfish. The lamprey GnRH was detected poorly by antisera directed at the 
      C-terminus, suggesting that a C-terminal amino acid substitution may have occurred 
      in the lamprey molecule compared with mammalian GnRH. In spite of this, lamprey and 
      mammalian GnRH-like molecules have the same retention time on an isocratic HPLC 
      system and parallel inhibition of mammalian 125I-GnRH in a radioimmunoassay. The 
      lamprey GnRH-like molecule has a distinct HPLC elution pattern compared with dogfish 
      shark, salmon, trout and probably birds. Thus lamprey GnRH represents another member 
      of the growing family of GnRH molecules. Additionally, lamprey GnRH may be a stem 
      molecule in the vertebrate evolution of GnRH.

AB  - During feeding, hagfish may immerse themselves in the body cavities of decaying 
      carcasses, encountering high levels of dissolved organic nutrients. We hypothesized 
      that this feeding environment might promote nutrient acquisition by the branchial 
      and epidermal epithelia. The potential for Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii, to 
      absorb amino acids from the environment across the skin and gill was thus 
      investigated. l-alanine and glycine were absorbed via specific transport pathways 
      across both gill and skin surfaces, the first such documentation of direct organic 
      nutrient acquisition in a vertebrate animal. Uptake occurred via distinct mechanisms 
      with respect to concentration dependence, sodium dependence and effects of putative 
      transport inhibitors across each epithelium. Significant differences in the absorbed 
      amino acid distribution between the skin of juveniles and adults were noted. The 
      ability to absorb dissolved organic matter across the skin and gill may be an 
      adaptation to a scavenging lifestyle, allowing hagfish to maximize sporadic 
      opportunities for organic nutrient acquisition. From an evolutionary perspective, 
      hagfish represent a transitory state between the generalized nutrient absorption 
      pathways of aquatic invertebrates and the more specialized digestive systems of 
      aquatic vertebrates.

TI  - Origins of the descending spinal projections in petromyzontid and myxinoid 
      agnathans.
PG  - 54-68
AB  - The origins of the descending spinal pathways in sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus), 
      silver lampreys (Ichthyomyzon unicuspis), and Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stouti) 
      were identified by the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) placed 
      in the rostral spinal cord. In lampreys, the majority of HRP-labeled cells were 
      located along the length of the brainstem reticular formation in the inferior, 
      middle, and superior reticular nuclei of the medulla, mesencephalic tegmentum, and 
      nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus. Labeled reticular cells included the 
      Mauthner and Müller cells. Horseradish-peroxidase-filled cells were also present in 
      the descending trigeminal tract, intermediate and posterior octavomotor nuclei, and 
      a diencephalic cell group, the nucleus of the posterior tubercle. As in lampreys, 
      the reticular formation of the Pacific hagfish was the largest source of descending 
      afferents to the spinal cord. Labeled cells were found in the dorsolateral and 
      ventromedial reticular nuclei, the dorsal tegmentum at the juncture of the medulla 
      and midbrain, and the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus. Additional 
      medullary cells projecting to the cord were located in the perivagal nucleus, the 
      central gray, and the anterior and posterior magnocellular octavolateralis nuclei. 
      The existence of reticulospinal and possible vestibulo-, trigemino-, and solitary 
      spinal projections in lampreys and hagfishes and the wide distribution of these 
      pathways in jawed vertebrates suggest that they evolved in the common ancestor of 
      gnathostomes and both groups of jawless fishes. However, descending spinal pathways 
      from the cerebellum, red nucleus, and telencephalon appear to be gnathostome 
      characters.

TI  - Identification of a homologue of CD59 in a cyclostome: implications for the 
      evolutionary development of the complement system.
PG  - 1-14
AB  - We have employed a COS cell expression cloning procedure to isolate a full length 
      cDNA clone encoding a hagfish leukocyte-associated membrane protein (HLMP1). The 
      protein, which is identified by a monoclonal antibody (JB3) generated in our 
      laboratory, is present on the majority of hagfish leukocytes and is also expressed 
      on erythrocytes. The cDNA clone contained an open reading frame encoding a 120 
      residue polypeptide which exhibits 33% amino acid sequence identity with the 
      precursor protein of human CD59, a leukocyte-associated membrane protein which 
      regulates the action of the complement membrane attack complex on homologous cells. 
      CD59 belongs to a family of structurally related glycoproteins which includes the 
      Ly-6 proteins expressed on mouse lymphocytes. In addition to significant overall 
      sequence homology HLMP1 shows conservation of 8 key cysteine residues with members 
      of the CD59/Ly-6 family. Comparison of the hagfish sequence with that of the mature 
      human CD59 protein suggested a processed protein consisting of 74 amino acids 
      associated with the cell membrane via a GPI anchor. The latter was confirmed by 
      immuno-flow cytometry following treatment of transfected COS cells with 
      phospholipase. Phylogenetic analysis and tissue distribution of this protein in the 
      hagfish are consistent with HLMP1 being a homologue of CD59. A three-dimensional 
      model of HLMP1, constructed using the NMR-determined structure for human CD59 as a 
      template, indicated conservation of a core structure of five strands of beta-sheet 
      and a short helix stabilised by four disulfide bonds. These findings, when taken 
      together with our previous identification of C5a-like chemotactic activity in 
      LPS-activated serum, provide indirect evidence for the existence of the terminal 
      lytic complement pathway (C5 to C9) in these primitive vertebrates.

TI  - Linkage regions between dermatan polysulfates and peptides.
PG  - 289-96
AB  - Three different types of dermatan polysulfate peptides I, II and III, isolated from 
      hagfish notochord, hagfish skin and shark skin, all contained serine, xylose and 
      galactose in a molar ratio of about 1.2 : 1 : 2. After beta-elimination-reduction, 
      dermatan polysulfate peptides II and III produced alanine and xylitol in amounts 
      equivalent to the amount of the serine decrease. Accordingly, it was shown that 
      these dermatan polysulfates were linked to peptides by O-glycosidic bond between 
      xylose and serine, as in chondroitin sulfates and dermatan sulfate. However, 
      dermatan polysulfate peptide I produced N-acetylgalactosaminitol, in addition to 
      alanine and xylitol, in a molar ratio of about 2 : 3 : 1, although the increase of 
      alanine was equivalent to the serine decrease. Consequently, it was concluded that 
      the linkage region of dermatan polysulfate peptide I has two types of O-glycosidic 
      bond: one between xylose and serine and the other between N-acetylgalactosamine and 
      serine. This is the first finding of an N-acetylgalactosamine involved in the 
      linkage region of glycosaminoglycans consisting of uronic acid as repeating 
      constituents.

TI  - Vascularization of the brains of the Atlantic and Pacific hagfishes, Myxine 
      glutinosa and Eptatretus stouti: a scanning electron microscope study of vascular 
      corrosion casts.
PG  - 51-63
AB  - The microvascularization of the brains of the hagfishes, Myxine glutinosa L. and 
      Eptatretus stouti, were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of 
      microvascular corrosion casts. Sections of these casts were used to determine the 
      vascular territories of defined brain areas. Histological serial sections (10 
      microm) of the brains served for correlation of findings. Analysis of the 
      microvascular casts of both species revealed that the blood supply to and from these 
      brains arose ventrally and dorsally, respectively. Neither species possesses an 
      arterial circle (Circulus Willisi) and both have similar microvascular patterns. The 
      only difference between Myxine and Eptatretus was that the posterior cerebral artery 
      in Myxine divides into mesencephalic and rhombencephalic branches, and in Eptatretus 
      a third branch, termed telencephalic branch, arises from the posterior cerebral 
      artery. 3D-morphometry revealed that luminal diameters of: 1) intracerebral arteries 
      and arterioles range from 35.11 +/- 5.66 microm (mean +/- SEM) in the hypothalamus 
      to 92.69 +/- 14.48 microm in the thalamus; 2) capillaries range from 17.8 +/- 0.44 
      microm in the olfactory bulb to 21.70 +/- 0.87 microm in the basal ganglia; and 3) 
      intracerebral venules and veins range from 49.38 +/- 4.17 microm in the hypothalamus 
      to 75.58 +/- 6.59 microm in the rhombencephalon. Interbranching distances of 
      arteries and arterioles range from 179.19 +/- 11.32 microm in the optic tectum to 
      235.19 +/- 94.64 microm in the hypothalamus. Capillaries range from 91.07 +/- 6.22 
      microm in the hypothalamus to 116.15 +/- 9.45 microm in the thalamus, and venules 
      and veins range from 137.30 +/- 18.11 microm in the hypothalamus to 189.83 +/- 17.47 
      microm in the optic tectum. Intervascular distances range from 70.58 +/- 3.58 microm 
      in the olfactory bulb to 89.52 +/- 5.74 microm in the optic tectum. Branching angles 
      of arteries and arterioles range from 38.39 +/- 10.9 degrees in the olfactory bulb 
      to 100.73 +/- 9.4 degrees in the optic tectum, and the branching angles of 
      capillaries range from 74.40 +/- 5.42 degrees in the optic tectum to 90.24 +/- 4.66 
      degrees in the olfactory bulb. Finally, the branching angles of the venules and 
      veins range from 67.84 +/- 6.83 degrees in the tegmentum of the mesencephalon to 
      92.30 +/- 6.35 degrees in the optic tectum.

TI  - Evidence from 18S ribosomal RNA sequences that lampreys and hagfishes form a natural 
      group.
PG  - 787-9
AB  - Lampreys and hagfishes (cyclostomes) traditionally were considered to be a natural 
      (monophyletic) group. Recently, the consensus of opinion, based largely on 
      morphological analyses, has shifted to a view that lampreys are more closely related 
      to jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) than to hagfishes. Phylogenetic comparisons of 
      18S ribosomal RNA sequences from two hagfishes, two lampreys, a tunicate, a 
      lancelet, and a number of gnathostomes support the monophyly of the cyclostomes. 
      These data force a reassessment of several features of early vertebrate evolution.

TI  - Hormone studies in Myxine glutinosa: failure of calcitonin to influence urine flow 
      or plasma and urine electrolyte balance.
PG  - 80-4
AB  - Hagfish, Myxine glutinosa, were used in a series of experiments to determine a 
      possible role for calcitonin in plasma and urine electrolyte balance. Individual 
      animals were anaesthetised and implanted with polythene cannulae for monitoring 
      blood pressure and for infusion/injection. Urine was collected by manual palpation 
      of the body surface whilst blood samples were withdrawn from the lateral sinus. 
      Following injection of either 1.25 or 3.75 micrograms kg body wt-1 calcitonin, there 
      was no significant change in either the plasma or urine composition of sodium, 
      potassium, calcium, or magnesium ion levels. These results indicate that calcitonin 
      may not be involved in electrolyte homeostasis in Myxine.

TI  - Cyclostome studies in the context of vertebrate evolution.
PG  - 953-4
LID - 10.2108/zsj.25.953 [doi]
AB  - The proceedings in this volume follow from the 15(th) Center for Developmental 
      Biology meeting on "Advances in Cyclostome Research" that we organized. The meeting 
      was held at the CDB RIKEN Kobe Institute on 24 and 25 January 2008 with support from 
      the CDB. Jawless vertebrates have been of interest to embryologists and comparative 
      morphologists for more than a century. While the comparative morphology among 
      lampreys, hagfishes, and gnathostomes has long been recognized in contributing to 
      understanding the origin of jaws and other gnathostome traits, the availability of 
      modern molecular methods has rekindled interest in these topics, and evolutionary 
      developmental biology coupled with paleontology has opened new avenues into the 
      study of gnathostome origins. Within the last decade, because of renewed interest in 
      evolutionary developmental biology, the importance of lampreys and hagfishes to our 
      understanding of vertebrate evolution has undergone resurgence in interest, as 
      evidenced by the sea lamprey genome project currently underway at the National Human 
      Genome Research Institute. As new molecular and imaging techniques become available, 
      both paleontological and neontological questions are being readdressed and are 
      providing new insights and speculation into vertebrate evolution. Thus, we 
      determined the timing was optimal to bring together many of the researchers 
      currently contributing to our understanding of the biology of agnathans. The 
      diversity of speakers at the meeting included evolutionary developmental biologists, 
      phylogenetics and genomics investigators, paleontologists, and endocrinology 
      researchers, because as we move into the 21(st) century, integration among these 
      disciplines has encouraged synergistic activities to develop. The goal of this 
      meeting was to highlight in a single setting the most recent advances in this 
      important basal group of vertebrates to facilitate interactions among the cyclostome 
      community. Secondarily, we also hope that this gathering will enhance the visibility 
      of jawless vertebrates as important models in the vertebrate "evo-devo" community. 
      Several topics for further discussion emerged at this symposium, including: genomic 
      data that have spurred renewed interest in gene duplications and their contribution 
      to our understanding of cyclostome phylogeny and vertebrate evolution; the use of 
      paleontology coupled with modern imaging techniques to clarify vertebrate phylogeny; 
      and the evolution of the neuroendocrine and adaptive immune systems. These were 
      among the topics that led to fruitful discussion. Here we summarize key research 
      topics from the symposium that continue to advance as we move forward in the 21(st) 
      century.

TI  - Phylogeny of insulin. Some evolutionary aspects of insulin production with 
      particular regard to the biosynthesis of insulin in Myxine glutinosa.
PG  - 15-25
AB  - Preceding phylogenetic studies on the occurrence of insulin have shown--e.g. by 
      bioassays and immunocytochemical procedures--that insulin producing B-cells are 
      present in all vertebrates and even in several invertebrates, both protostomian and 
      deuterostomian. The most original B-cells are obviously endocrine cells of open 
      type, situated in the mucosa of the alimentary tract. Moreover, the results of these 
      studies show that insulin is not only a polypeptide hormone of considerable age but 
      also that the insulin molecule seems to have been kept surprisingly stable during 
      evolution. Best known of all non-mammalian insulins is that from the hagfish, Myxine 
      glutinosa. It is probably the most original insulin of all in the vertebrate series. 
      Both the amino-acid sequence and the three-dimensional structure of the dimer of 
      hagfish insulin differ only little from those of pig insulin. The biosynthesis 
      occurs via proinsulin and is also in most respects similar to mammalian insulin 
      biosynthesis. There are, however, some differences. Although it readily crystallizes 
      as tetragonal bipyramids, hagfish insulin does not form hexamers. In a test system, 
      with isolated rat fat cells, its binding affinity is 23% and its potency 5% of that 
      of pig insulin, a discrepancy indicating a "partial antagonism" on the receptors. 
      Although the conversion of proinsulin to insulin seems to occur in the secretion 
      granules, they contain no crystalline cores. Since a strictly tryptic-like enzyme 
      was found to destroy hagfish insulin rapidly, the enzyme converting proinsulin to 
      insulin must--in addition to a carboxy-peptidase-B-like activity--have a different 
      specificity in Myxine.

TI  - Cardiac metabolism in the Myxinidae: physiological and phylogenetic considerations.
PG  - 495-505
AB  - Cardiac muscle hearts of Atlantic hagfish continuously function under hypoxic 
      conditions that would lead to cardiac failure in most other vertebrates. Contractile 
      performance of hagfish systemic hearts is resistant to anoxia and respiratory 
      poisons but shows a significant decrement when carbohydrate catabolism is blocked by 
      0.5 mM iodoacetic acid. Enzyme activity profiles of hagfish ventricle reveal a 
      robust capacity for glycolysis of carbohydrate in comparison to that for general 
      aerobic metabolism and catabolism of alternate metabolic fuels. Isolated working 
      hagfish ventricles preferentially oxidize radiolabeled glucose even when fatty acid 
      fuels are present in the incubation medium. Work output of the isolated ventricular 
      preparation is maintained only in the presence of exogenous glucose. The results 
      indicate that energy metabolism of the hagfish myocardium is predominantly 
      carbohydrate-based and that energy demand of the tissue can be sustained by 
      anaerobic glycolysis during extended periods of extreme hypoxia. Cardiac metabolism 
      of this primitive species is compared with that of hearts from higher vertebrates 
      and an evolutionary hypothesis relating cardiac workload to preferred metabolic fuel 
      is discussed.

TI  - Concerted evolution of a highly repetitive DNA family in eptatretidae (Cyclostomata, 
      agnatha) implies specifically differential homogenization and amplification events 
      in their germ cells.
PG  - 154-69
AB  - In eight hagfish species, it is known that chromosome elimination occurs during 
      early embryogenesis, and some highly repetitive DNA families, restricted to germ 
      cells, have been isolated. One of these families, "EEEo2," has been isolated as DNA 
      fragments by restriction enzyme analyses from Eptatretus okinoseanus and E. 
      cirrhatus. In this study, EEEo2 sequences were isolated from germline DNA in E. 
      burgeri, Paramyxine sheni, and P. atami using PCR methods. Sequence analysis 
      revealed that these sequences are intraspecifically homogeneous, except in E. 
      burgeri, and are interspecifically conserved with heterogeneity. The intraspecific 
      sequence variability tends to decrease as the copy number increases. These results 
      indicate that EEEo2 has evolved in a concerted manner. Moreover, an ancestral 
      repeating motif consisting of triplicate subrepeats was deduced. These results 
      suggest that EEEo2 arose as an initial amplification of this subrepeat and has 
      evolved by saltatory replication. Phylogenetic analyses suggested the possibility 
      that EEEo2 in E. okinoseanus and E. cirrhatus has been subjected to strong 
      homogenizing forces for concerted evolution, whereas the force is weak in E. 
      burgeri. In addition, EEEo2 in P. sheni and P. atami appear to have been 
      incompletely subjected to these forces. Chromosomal in situ hybridization 
      experiments revealed that EEEo2 sequences were located along almost their entire 
      length of several heterochromatic chromosomes that are restricted to germ cells. 
      These chromosomes are disposed to form a secondary association during the first 
      meiotic metaphases, except in P. sheni. This chromosomal distribution may promote a 
      concerted mode of sequence evolution in both nonhomologous chromosomes and 
      homologous chromosomes and reflect the differential driving forces between species.

TI  - A cell-surface opsonic receptor on leucocytes from the phylogenetically primitive 
      vertebrate, Eptatretus stouti.
PG  - 326-32
AB  - A humoral recognition molecule that is homologous to the mammalian complement 
      components C3, C4 and C5 has recently been identified in the Pacific hagfish, 
      Eptatretus stouti. One function of this complement-like protein (CLP) is to opsonize 
      foreign material for phagocytosis by hagfish leucocytes. Here, we demonstrate that 
      CLP's opsonic activity can be abrogated by pre-incubating phagocytes with an 
      anti-hagfish leucocyte mAb (1B1). Moreover, antigen-activated CLP can block the 
      binding of the 1B1 antibody to hagfish leucocytes. Flow cytometry and 
      immunoprecipitation indicate that 1B1 recognizes a 105 kDa cell-surface, monomeric 
      protein that is expressed exclusively on phagocytic hagfish leucocytes. It is 
      concluded that this 105 kDa protein represents the cell surface receptor by which 
      CLP mediates the phagocytosis of opsonized targets.

TI  - Distinct Ig H chains in a primitive vertebrate, Eptatretus stouti.
PG  - 3823-8
AB  - Serum Ig from the Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stouti, was isolated by affinity 
      chromatography using a specific mAb (H.45). Analysis of the approximately 210-kDa 
      molecule by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions revealed two H chains of 
      approximately 77 kDa (H1) and approximately 70 kDa (H2) and L chains of 
      approximately 30 kDa. H1 and H2 were shown to differ with respect to their peptide 
      maps, amino-terminal amino acid sequences, and reactivity to the mAb H.45, 
      suggesting that they represent discrete H chain isotypes. Two-dimensional 
      nonreducing/reducing SDS-PAGE demonstrated that H and L chains were covalently 
      linked predominantly as H-H-L and H-L configurations. Noncovalently bound L chains 
      were also found. H-H-L complexes were shown to contain H1-H2 heterodimers of H 
      chains in addition to H1-H1 homodimers.

TI  - Germ line-restricted supernumerary (B) chromosomes in Eptatretus okinoseanus.
PG  - 224-8
AB  - Cytogenetic studies were performed on two types of Japanese hagfish (Eptatretus 
      okinoseanus) that eliminate about 45% (type A) and 55% (type B) of their DNA from 
      presumptive somatic cells during the differentiation of somatic cells. The 
      observations revealed inter- and intraindividual variations in the number of 
      chromosomes in germ cells of both types of hagfishes. Although the modal number of 
      chromosomes in the germ cells was 54 in both types, the percentage of cells with the 
      modal number was rather low (38.6% [51/132] in five specimens of type A and 22.7% 
      [25/110] in eight specimens of type B). In addition, one of seven type B specimens 
      clearly had a modal number of 62 chromosomes. Another specimen of type B had a 
      bimodal distribution of chromosome numbers, with peaks of 54 and 59 chromosomes. The 
      observation of interindividual variations was supported by data on the amount of DNA 
      in germ cells of type B specimens. However, these variations were rarely observed in 
      somatic cells. These results suggest that supernumerary (B) chromosomes are 
      maintained in germ cells and are eliminated together with some other chromosomes 
      and/or chromatin from somatic cells.

TI  - Insulin-like immunoreactivity in the brain of two hagfishes, Eptatretus stouti and 
      Myxine glutinosa.
PG  - 371-81
AB  - Immunocytochemical investigation of the brains of hagfish Myxine glutinosa and 
      Eptatretus stouti with antisera raised against salmon insulin revealed the presence 
      of groups of immunoreactive cells discretely localized in the mid- and hindbrain of 
      both species. Subpopulations of these cells reacted weakly with antisera against 
      Myxine islet insulin and equivocally with anti-bovine insulin serum. Extracts 
      prepared from Myxine brain were subject to gel filtration and were found by 
      radioimmunoassay to contain two forms of insulin-like material, one of large 
      molecular weight (less than 66 kDa) and another smaller molecule (6 kDa). The 
      relationship of these molecules to the insulin-related growth factor family of 
      neurohormonal peptides is discussed and their potential function assessed in terms 
      of a possible homology with Muller-type cells and involvement in axonal regeneration 
      phenomena.

TI  - Filtration characteristics of the single isolated perfused glomerulus of Myxine 
      glutinosa.
PG  - 276-84
AB  - Using an in vitro microperfusion technique, the filtration characteristics of single 
      isolated glomeruli of the Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) were investigated. The 
      suitability of the method as a model to study glomerular function was evaluated. 
      Experiments with a protein-free perfusate led to a filtration coefficient Kf (0.189 
      +/- 0.181 nl x s-1 x mm Hg-1) that was in the same order of magnitude as determined 
      in vitro for other vertebrates. Morphometric analysis on serial thin sections (1 
      microns) revealed a glomerular capillary surface (A) of 1.84 +/- 0.72 mm2. A linear 
      relationship between glomerular diameter and A allowed the calculation of the 
      hydraulic conductivity Lp (0.618 +/- 0.384 microliter x s-1 x mmHg-1 x cm-2). The 
      data indicate that the isolated perfused glomerulus of M. glutinosa has filtration 
      characteristics similar to higher vertebrates. The glomeruli of M. glutinosa, which 
      in contrast to glomeruli of other animals are easy to dissect, are a suitable model 
      for the study of glomerular filtration and permeability characteristics of 
      vertebrates. An example of a possible application of the model is a study into the 
      effects of adrenaline on glomerular filtration characteristics. Adrenaline led to 
      increases in ultrafiltration pressure (PUF), single nephron glomerular filtration 
      rate (SNGFR) and filtration fraction (FF); Kf remained unaffected.

TI  - Plasma thyroid hormones in cyclostomes: do they have a role in regulation of 
      glycemic levels?
PG  - 97-107
AB  - Plasma levels of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) were measured by 
      radioimmunoassay in intact Pacific lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus) undergoing the 
      period of natural fasting and in Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stouti) maintained 
      unfed in the laboratory. Plasma T3 levels in both lamprey and hagfish were always 
      severalfold lower than T4 levels. The influence of thyroid hormones on glycemic 
      level was studied following intraperitoneal injection of T4 or T3 (13-20 
      micrograms/100 g body wt), as well as after implantation of sealed Silastic capsules 
      containing the goitrogen, 6-propylthiouracil (6-PTU), or after intraperitoneal 
      injections of an antithyroglobulin serum (ATgS) exhibiting both anti-T4 and anti-T3 
      activities. Measured plasma T4 and T3 levels after hormonal injection were extremely 
      high and could be considered pharmacological. The 6-PTU treatment decreased plasma 
      levels of both T4 and T3 within several weeks. The glycemic levels in lampreys and 
      hagfish after thyroid hormone treatment were lower than in control animals, whereas 
      in animals treated with either 6-PTU or ATgS, hyperglycemic levels prevailed. It is 
      concluded that thyroid hormones, possibly acting with other hormones, may 
      participate in the maintenance of glycemic levels in cyclostomes and that their 
      action is to reduce glycemic levels.

TI  - Ultrastructural evidence for a direct connection between the myocardial granules and 
      the sarcoplasmic reticulum in the cardiac ventricle of Myxine glutinosa (L.).
PG  - 353-63
AB  - The occurrence of structural connections between myocardial granules and tubular 
      elements of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in the cardiac ventricle of the Atlantic 
      hagfish is described. The core substance of the myocardial granules is shown to be 
      uranophilic and in this respect similar to the granular cores within the lumen of 
      the sarcoplasmic reticulum. After application of CaCl2-containing fixatives, the 
      ultrastructure of the core substance of these organelles resembles that described 
      for calcium-containing structures in vertebrate glial cells. Incidences of 
      uranophilic core substance in the extracellular space suggest a secretory function 
      of the myocardial granules. Possible implications of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and 
      the myocardial granules in storage, intracellular transport, and secretion of bound 
      calcium are discussed.

TI  - Calcium paradox from cyclostome to man: a comparative study.
PG  - 801-5
AB  - In seven poikilotherm species, i.e. cyclostome, Myxine glutinosa; teleosts, Gadus 
      morrhua; Platichtys flesus; amphibia, R. pipiens; R. temporaria; Xenopus laevis; 
      reptiles, Vipera berus. Ca paradox could not be obtained in ventricular strips at 
      8-12 degrees C. In similar preparations from human atria at 30 degrees C and 37 
      degrees, Ca paradox was obtained similarly as in other homoiotherms. In 
      homoiotherms, lowered temperature (below 30 degrees C) has a protective effect. 
      Viper myocardium did not display Ca paradox at 12, 22 or 32 degrees C, whereas human 
      myocardium displayed Ca paradox even at 30 C. It is postulated that the absence of 
      Ca paradox in poikilotherms is not due to the low temperature. In hagfish (Myxine 
      glutinosa) the absence of Ca paradox seems to be due to the specific conditions 
      concerning Ca exchange in the myocardial cell (large glycocalyx).

AB  - A checklist of the Monogeneans and Coelenterates parasitizing fishes in the Volga 
      River basin is given. The list of hosts with the data on their occurrence in 
      different areas of the Volga River basin is provided for each parasite species. The 
      data on the parasites from 46 fish species are presented. The checklist includes 139 
      species and 6 taxa of subspecific rank. 9 species (Dactylogyrus aristichthys, D. 
      ctenopharyngodonis, D. hypophthalmichthys, D. lamellatus, D. nobilis, D. 
      suchengtaii, Pseudodactylogyrus bini, P. microrchis, and Eudiplozoon nipponicum) 
      were introduced into the Volga River basin accidentally together with the Far 
      Eastern fish species during the process of their naturalization.

TI  - Annulate lamellae and crystalline inclusions in granular endoplasmic reticulum of 
      the islet organ and associated tissues of a cyclostome, Myxine glutinosa.
PG  - 75-87
AB  - Cytoplasmic annylate lamellae were found in the islet organ of a cyclostome, the 
      hagfish (Myxine glutinosa), predominantly in cells interpreted as young 
      proliferating beta-cells, and also in endocrine cells and enterocytes of the bile 
      duct and gut and in the endothelial cells of small blood vessels. A close 
      association was observed annulate lamellae and granular endoplasmic reticulum. Both 
      in cells with and in those without annulate lamellae, crystalline inclusions of 
      proteinaceous nature were seen in granular endoplasmic reticulum. These inclusions 
      were occasionally closely associated to annulate lamellae, and a direct continuity 
      could be seen between granular endoplasmic reticulum and the outer nuclear membrane 
      surrounding an inclusion partially situated in the perinuclear cisterna. Rod-shaped 
      structures and rounded electron dense bodies were seen in the nuclei of some islet 
      parenchymal cells. The presence of annulate lamellae in the islet organ and 
      associated tissues of Myxine glutinosa is believed to be related to the very high 
      phylogenetic age of this species. The close association observed between annulate 
      lamellae, granular endoplasmic reticulum, crystalline inclusions, and sometimes also 
      nuclear membranes, may be of functional significance.

TI  - X-ray microanalysis on the thyroid follicle of the hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri and 
      lamprey, Lampetra japonica.
PG  - 283-90
AB  - Intracellular dense bodies, cytoplasmic matrices, and luminal colloids in the 
      thyroid follicle of cyclostomes, hagfish and lamprey were examined to identify the 
      distribution of iodine using an energy dispersive X-ray microanalyzer attached to a 
      scanning transmission electron microscope. High level of iodine was detected only in 
      the large dense body of the hagfishes, while it was too slight in quantity to detect 
      by this method in the cytoplasmic matrix as well as in the luminal colloid. In the 
      adult lamprey thyroid, an appreciable amount of iodine was detected in a few large 
      dense bodies. In mice and rats, it is very hard to detect iodine in the luminal 
      colloid, intracellular colloid droplet, and in the lysosomal dense granule by this 
      method, though these structures have been well known to contain a fairly large 
      amount of iodine which is combined with thyroglobulin. These facts mean that 
      intracellular dense bodies in the thyroid follicular epithelium of the cytoclostome, 
      especially of the hagfish have an extremely larger amount of iodine. These bodies 
      are considered to be secondary lysosomes or residual bodies containing reabsorbed 
      colloid materials which are highly condensed.

TI  - Nebulin is a thin filament protein of the cardiac muscle of the agnathans.
PG  - 205-13
AB  - Nebulin is an integral protein of skeletal muscle thin filaments and probably acts 
      as a ruler for the thin filament length. Cardiac muscles of higher vertebrates have 
      been shown earlier to lack nebulin. Instead in human and chicken cardiac muscle the 
      much smaller protein nebulette replaces nebulin. Since nebulette is confined to the 
      Z-disc region of the sarcomere and does not span the whole thin filament length, it 
      must have functions significantly different from those assumed for nebulin. We have 
      investigated nebulin in skeletal and cardiac muscles of the agnathans (lamprey, 
      hagfish), elasmobranchs (shark), chondrosts (sturgeon) and teleosts (trout, eel) by 
      SDS-PAGE and immunodetection methods. Among these, lamprey and hagfish cardiac 
      muscles are unique in that both contain full-length nebulin identical in molecular 
      mass to the nebulin of the respective body muscle. Using immunofluorescence 
      microscopy, lamprey cardiac nebulin was localised in the I-band of the sarcomere, 
      the same as for nebulin in skeletal muscle. In contrast to this, all gnathostome 
      species investigated lacked nebulin in cardiac muscles, while it was present in the 
      respective skeletal muscles. This clearly shows that nebulin is not exclusively 
      present in skeletal muscles of chordates. The findings also demonstrate a rare case 
      of dramatic size reduction of a protein during evolution.

TI  - Immunocytochemistry of cardiac polypeptide hormones (cardiodilatin/atrial

PG  - 233-9
AB  - With the use of different region-specific antisera against partial sequences of 
      porcine cardiodilatin (CDD)-126 and the peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) technique, 
      the central nervous system as well as the systemic and the portal vein heart of the 
      cyclostomian species Myxine glutinosa were investigated for a possible existence of 
      cardiac polypeptides. In contrast to mammals, CDD-immunoreactions were obtained only 
      with antisera directed against the C-terminus of CDD (CDD 99-126) which is identical 
      to human atrial natriuretic polypeptide (alpha hANP). CDD-immunoreactive 
      myocardiocytes were found in high densities in the atrium of the systemic heart and 
      in the portal vein heart. In the ventricle of the systemic heart, CDD-immunoreactive 
      cells were extremely scarce. In agreement with the immunohistochemical results, 
      myoendocrine cells analyzed by electronmicroscopy exhibited specific granules of an 
      average diameter of 0.21 + 0.02 micron in equivalent localizations. Furthermore, 
      with the use of the protein A-gold (PAG) technique, CDD-immunoreactivity was 
      ultrastructurally localized within the specific granules of atrial myocardiocytes. 
      In the central nervous system of Myxine glutinosa, CDD-immunoreactive perikarya 
      and/or fibers were present on all levels from the telencephalon to the spinal cord. 
      The results of the present study are compared with those obtained in mammals and 
      their possible functional relevance and their meaning in phylogeny are discussed as 
      well.

      both lampreys and hagfishes. The results indicate that fibronectin or a 
      fibronectin-like material is a major component of agnathan connective tissues. 
      Although there were some variations in the localization of fibronectin both between 
      the lamprey and the hagfish and between agnathan and other vertebrate tissues, the 
      generalized pattern of distribution of fibronectin in the agnathans supports the 
      view that this protein, like that in higher vertebrates, plays a role in cell-matrix 
      adhesion and tissue organization.

PG  - 273-84
AB  - To determine if vascular smooth muscle from teleost and agnathan fishes expresses 
      receptors for signaling agents that are important in vascular tension in other 
      vertebrates, we exposed rings of aortic vascular smooth muscle from the eel 
      (Anguilla rostrata), the hagfish (Myxine glutinosa), and the lamprey (Petromyzon 
      marinus) to a suite of putative agonists, including: acetylcholine, endothelin, 
      nitric oxide, natriuretic peptides, and prostanoids. Acetylcholine constricted 
      aortic rings from the eel, but had no effect on the rings from lamprey. On the other 
      hand, endothelin constricted rings from all three species. Use of receptor-specific 
      ET agonists demonstrated that only ET(A) receptors are expressed in the eel and 
      lamprey aorta. The nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside or nitric oxide itself 
      dilated rings from the eel, but both agonists constricted rings from the hagfish and 
      NO produced a biphasic response (constriction followed by dilation) in the lamprey. 
      Two natriuretic peptides, eel ANP and porcine CNP, produced marginally significant 
      dilation in the eel aorta, human ANP dilated the hagfish rings, and pCNP and eANP 
      dilated the lamprey rings. The prostanoids PGE(1) and PGE(2) both dilated the eel 
      aortic rings, and PGE(1) and carbaprostacyclin (stable PGI(2) agonist) dilated the 
      hagfish and lamprey rings. Our results suggest that receptors for a variety of 
      vasoactive signaling agents are expressed in the aortic smooth muscle of the 
      earliest vertebrates (lamprey and hagfish), as well as the more advanced teleosts 
      (eel).

TI  - Genomic donor cassette sharing during VLRA and VLRC assembly in jawless vertebrates.
PG  - 14828-33
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1415580111 [doi]
AB  - Lampreys possess two T-like lymphocyte lineages that express either variable 
      lymphocyte receptor (VLR) A or VLRC antigen receptors. VLRA(+) and VLRC(+) 
      lymphocytes share many similarities with the two principal T-cell lineages of jawed 
      vertebrates expressing the αβ and γδ T-cell receptors (TCRs). During the assembly of 
      VLR genes, several types of genomic cassettes are inserted, in step-wise fashion, 
      into incomplete germ-line genes to generate the mature forms of antigen receptor 
      genes. Unexpectedly, the structurally variable components of VLRA and VLRC receptors 
      often possess partially identical sequences; this phenomenon of module sharing 
      between these two VLR isotypes occurs in both lampreys and hagfishes. By contrast, 
      VLRA and VLRC molecules typically do not share their building blocks with the 
      structurally analogous VLRB receptors that are expressed by B-like lymphocytes. Our 
      studies reveal that VLRA and VLRC germ-line genes are situated in close proximity to 
      each other in the lamprey genome and indicate the interspersed arrangement of 
      isotype-specific and shared genomic donor cassettes; these features may facilitate 
      the shared cassette use. The genomic structure of the VLRA/VLRC locus in lampreys is 
      reminiscent of the interspersed nature of the TCRA/TCRD locus in jawed vertebrates 
      that also allows the sharing of some variable gene segments during the 
      recombinatorial assembly of TCR genes.

TI  - Hagfish slime threads as a biomimetic model for high performance protein fibres.
PG  - 035002
LID - 10.1088/1748-3182/5/3/035002 [doi]
AB  - Textile manufacturing is one of the largest industries in the world, and synthetic 
      fibres represent two-thirds of the global textile market. Synthetic fibres are 
      manufactured from petroleum-based feedstocks, which are becoming increasingly 
      expensive as demand for finite petroleum reserves continues to rise. For the last 
      three decades, spider silks have been held up as a model that could inspire the 
      production of protein fibres exhibiting high performance and ecological 
      sustainability, but unfortunately, artificial spider silks have yet to fulfil this 
      promise. Previous work on the biomechanics of protein fibres from the slime of 
      hagfishes suggests that these fibres might be a superior biomimetic model to spider 
      silks. Based on the fact that the proteins within these 'slime threads' adopt 
      conformations that are similar to those in spider silks when they are stretched, we 
      hypothesized that draw processing of slime threads should yield fibres that are 
      comparable to spider dragline silk in their mechanical performance. Here we show 
      that draw-processed slime threads are indeed exceptionally strong and tough. We also 
      show that post-drawing steps such as annealing, dehydration and covalent 
      cross-linking can dramatically improve the long-term dimensional stability of the 
      threads. The data presented here suggest that hagfish slime threads are a model that 
      should be pursued in the quest to produce fibres that are ecologically sustainable 
      and economically viable.

LID - e1000025
AB  - The skeleton is one of the most important features for the reconstruction of 
      vertebrate phylogeny but few data are available to understand its molecular origin. 
      In mammals the Runt genes are central regulators of skeletogenesis. Runx2 was shown 
      to be essential for osteoblast differentiation, tooth development, and bone 
      formation. Both Runx2 and Runx3 are essential for chondrocyte maturation. 
      Furthermore, Runx2 directly regulates Indian hedgehog expression, a master 
      coordinator of skeletal development. To clarify the correlation of Runt gene 
      evolution and the emergence of cartilage and bone in vertebrates, we cloned the Runt 
      genes from hagfish as representative of jawless fish (MgRunxA, MgRunxB) and from 
      dogfish as representative of jawed cartilaginous fish (ScRunx1-3). According to our 
      phylogenetic reconstruction the stem species of chordates harboured a single Runt 
      gene and thereafter Runt locus duplications occurred during early vertebrate 
      evolution. All newly isolated Runt genes were expressed in cartilage according to 
      quantitative PCR. In situ hybridisation confirmed high MgRunxA expression in hard 
      cartilage of hagfish. In dogfish ScRunx2 and ScRunx3 were expressed in embryonal 
      cartilage whereas all three Runt genes were detected in teeth and placoid scales. In 
      cephalochordates (lancelets) Runt, Hedgehog and SoxE were strongly expressed in the 
      gill bars and expression of Runt and Hedgehog was found in endo- as well as 
      ectodermal cells. Furthermore we demonstrate that the lancelet Runt protein binds to 
      Runt binding sites in the lancelet Hedgehog promoter and regulates its activity. 
      Together, these results suggest that Runt and Hedgehog were part of a core gene 
      network for cartilage formation, which was already active in the gill bars of the 
      common ancestor of cephalochordates and vertebrates and diversified after Runt 
      duplications had occurred during vertebrate evolution. The similarities in 
      expression patterns of Runt genes support the view that teeth and placoid scales 
      evolved from a homologous developmental module.

TI  - The amino acid sequence of the insulin from a primitive vertebrate, the atlantic 
      hagfish (Myxine glutinosa).
PG  - 5183-91
AB  - Insulin has been isolated and purified from the islet organs of the cyclostome, 
      Myxine glutinosa, by means of acid-ethanol extraction, fractional precipitation, and 
      gel filtration. The complete amino acid sequence of the hormone has been determined 
      by Edman degradation of the S-carboxymethylated or performic acid-oxidized A and B 
      chains, and of various tryptic peptides derived from the chains. The 52-residue 
      hagfish insulin has many structural features in common with other vertebrate 
      insulins including the locations of the 6 half-cystine residues, the NH2-terminal 7 
      residues and the COOH-terminal 6 residues of the A chain, and several shorter 
      sequences in the B chain that are known to comprise the dimer interface in porcine 
      insulin crystals. Of the 24 residues which are invariant among the other known 
      insulins, 23 are identical in hagfish int 16 of these sites it contains residues not 
      previously observed in vertebrate insulins. The B chain also contains an additional 
      COOH-terminal residue of methionine, making it 1 residue longer than the usual 
      30-residue mammalian B chains. Several features of the tertiary and quaternary 
      structure of hagfish insulin, including the probable absence of a metal 
      ion-stabilized hexameric form, are discussed on the basis of these findings. The 
      results suggest that the conformation of the insulin molecule has been well 
      conserved throughout the entire evolution of the vertebrates.

TI  - Protein tyrosine phosphatases from amphioxus, hagfish, and ray: divergence of 
      tissue-specific isoform genes in the early evolution of vertebrates.
PG  - 302-11
AB  - Since separation from fungi and plants, multicellular animals evolved a variety of 
      gene families involved in cell-cell communication from a limited number of ancestral 
      precursors by gene duplications in two separate periods of animal evolution. In the 
      very early evolution of animals before the separation of parazoans and eumetazoans, 
      animals underwent extensive gene duplications by which different subtypes 
      (subfamilies) with distinct functions diverged. The multiplicity of members 
      (isoforms) in the same subtype increased by further gene duplications (isoform 
      duplications) in the first half of chordate evolution before the fish-tetrapod 
      split; different isoforms are virtually identical in structure and function but 
      differ in tissue distribution. From cloning and phylogenetic analyses of four 
      subfamilies of the protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) family, we recently showed 
      extensive isoform duplications in a limited period around or just before the 
      cyclostome-gnathostome split. To obtain a reliable estimate for the divergence time 
      of vertebrate isoforms, we have conducted isolation of cDNAs encoding the protein 
      tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) from Branchiostoma belcheri, an amphioxus, Eptatretus 
      burgeri, a hagfish, and Potamotrygon motoro, a ray. We obtained 33 different cDNAs 
      in total, most of which belong to known PTP subfamilies. The phylogenetic analyses 
      of five subfamilies based on the maximum likelihood method revealed frequent isoform 
      duplications in a period around or just before the gnathostome-cyclostome split. An 
      evolutionary implication was discussed in relation to the Cambrian explosion.

TI  - Evolution of prothrombin: isolation and characterization of the cDNAs encoding 
      chicken and hagfish prothrombin.
PG  - 177-87
AB  - The cDNA sequences of chicken and hagfish prothrombin have been determined. The 
      sequences predict that prothrombin from both species is synthesized as a 
      prepro-protein consisting of a putative Gla domain, two kringle domains, and a 
      two-chain protease domain. Chicken and hagfish prothrombin share 51.6% amino acid 
      sequence identity (313/627 residues). Both chicken and hagfish prothrombin are 
      structurally very similar to human, bovine, rat, and mouse prothrombin and all six 
      species share 41% amino acid sequence identity. Amino acid sequence alignments of 
      human, bovine, rat, mouse, chicken, and hagfish prothrombin suggest that the 
      thrombin B-chain and the propeptide-Gla domain are the regions most constrained for 
      the common function(s) of vertebrate prothrombins.

PG  - 936-42
AB  - The cloaca of Myxine glutinosa was examined by histochemical and scanning electron 
      microscopical methods. No copulation organ could be found in Myxine and no 
      detectable differences in the anatomy of the cloaca between male and female Myxine 
      glutinosa. The anal gland which is the only gland in the cloacal region is situated 
      between rectum and ductus coelomaticus. Like the lateral mucous glands in the 
      epidermis it consists of large mucous gland cells, thread cells and undifferentiated 
      cells. The cloacal epithelium neither develops a spatial separation by folds nor a 
      ciliation is present in the caudal and dorsal part of the cloacal chamber. Therefore 
      female and male myxinoides do not show any structures which would allow 
      transportation of sperm into the abdominal cavity or out of it.

TI  - Comparative analysis of autoxidation of haemoglobin.
PG  - 2029-33
AB  - Autoxidation of oxyhaemoglobin (oxyHb) to methaemoglobin was measured at different 
      temperatures in haemoglobin solutions from Atlantic hagfish, river lamprey, common 
      carp, yellowfin tuna and pig. The aims were to evaluate the impact of the absent 
      distal histidine in hagfish haemoglobin, the importance of oxyHb being either 
      monomeric (hagfish and lamprey) or tetrameric (carp, tuna and pig) and to gain 
      information on the temperature-sensitivity of autoxidation. The rate of autoxidation 
      was lower in hagfish than in carp, yellowfin tuna and lamprey haemoglobins at any 
      given temperature. Substitution of the distal histidine residue (His E7) with 
      glutamine in hagfish haemoglobin was therefore not associated with an accelerated 
      autoxidation, as might be expected on the basis of the normal protective role of His 
      E7. Glutamine may have similar qualities to histidine and be involved in the low 
      susceptibility to autoxidation. The low oxidation rate of hagfish haemoglobin, 
      together with an oxidation rate of lamprey haemoglobin that did not differ from that 
      of carp and yellowfin tuna haemoglobins, also revealed that autoxidation was not 
      accelerated in the monomeric oxyhaemoglobins. Pig haemoglobin was oxidised more 
      slowly than fish haemoglobins, demonstrating that fish haemoglobins are more 
      sensitive to autoxidation than mammalian haemoglobins. The rate of autoxidation of 
      hagfish haemoglobin was, however, only significantly greater than that of pig 
      haemoglobin at high temperatures. Autoxidation was accelerated by rising temperature 
      in all haemoglobins. Arrhenius plots of carp and yellowfin tuna haemoglobin revealed 
      a break at 25 degrees C, reflecting a lower temperature-sensitivity between 5 and 25 
      degrees C than between 25 and 40 degrees C.

TI  - Oxygen dependency of hydrogen sulfide-mediated vasoconstriction in cyclostome 
      aortas.
PG  - 2205-13
LID - 10.1242/jeb.016766 [doi]
AB  - Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) has been proposed to mediate hypoxic vasoconstriction 
      (HVC), however, other studies suggest the vasoconstrictory effect indirectly results 
      from an oxidation product of H(2)S. Here we examined the relationship between H(2)S 
      and O(2) in isolated hagfish and lamprey vessels that exhibit profound hypoxic 
      vasoconstriction. In myographic studies, H(2)S (Na(2)S) dose-dependently constricted 
      dorsal aortas (DA) and efferent branchial arteries (EBA) but did not affect ventral 
      aortas or afferent branchial arteries; effects similar to those produced by hypoxia. 
      Sensitivity of H(2)S-mediated contraction in hagfish and lamprey DA was enhanced by 
      hypoxia. HVC in hagfish DA was enhanced by the H(2)S precursor cysteine and 
      inhibited by amino-oxyacetate, an inhibitor of the H(2)S-synthesizing enzyme, 
      cystathionine beta-synthase. HVC was unaffected by propargyl glycine, an inhibitor 
      of cystathionine lambda-lyase. Oxygen consumption (M(O(2))) of hagfish DA was 
      constant between 15 and 115 mmHg P(O(2)) (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa), decreased when P(O(2)) 
      <15 mmHg, and increased after P(O(2)) exceeded 115 mmHg. 10 micromol l(-1) H(2)S 
      increased and > or =100 micromol l(-1) H(2)S decreased M(O(2)). Consistent with the 
      effects on HVC, cysteine increased and amino-oxyacetate decreased M(O(2)). These 
      results show that H(2)S is a monophasic vasoconstrictor of specific cyclostome 
      vessels and because hagfish lack vascular NO, and vascular sensitivity to H(2)S was 
      enhanced at low P(O(2)), it is unlikely that H(2)S contractions are mediated by 
      either H(2)S-NO interaction or an oxidation product of H(2)S. These experiments also 
      provide additional support for the hypothesis that the metabolism of H(2)S is 
      involved in oxygen sensing/signal transduction in vertebrate vascular smooth muscle.

TI  - Properties of muscle phosphorylase b from a hagfish, Paramyxine atami.
PG  - 279-85
AB  - Phosphorylase b was purified to homogeneity from the muscle of a hagfish (Paramyxine 
      atami), as judged by electrophoretic and immunological criteria. The purified enzyme 
      was partially but not fully activated by AMP, and its conversion into the a form 
      resulted in a three-fold increase in activity. The enzyme was stimulated by SO4(2-), 
      and kinetic experiments showed that SO4(2-) markedly increased the affinity of 
      enzyme toward substrates: in the presence and absence of 0.35 M SO4(2-), the 
      apparent Km values of hagfish phosphorylase b were 0.04 and 1.3% for glycogen, 8.7 
      and 66 mM for glucose 1-phosphate, and 0.05 and 1.0 mM for AMP, respectively. 
      Electrophoretic and immunological data indicated that the hagfish possessed a single 
      molecular form of phosphorylase, like the lamprey. Some immunological relatedness 
      between the hagfish enzyme and the enzyme from lamprey or skate was demonstrated.

AB  - The RH gene family in vertebrates consists of four major genes (RH, RHAG, RHBG, and 
      RHCG). They are thought to have emerged in the common ancestor of vertebrates after 
      two rounds of whole genome duplication (2R-WGD). To analyze the detailed 
      phylogenetic relationships within the RH gene family, we determined three types of 
      cDNA sequence that belong to the RH gene family in lamprey (Lethenteron reissneri) 
      and designated them as RHBG-like, RHCG-like1, and RHCG-like2. Phylogenetic analyses 
      clearly showed that RHCG-like1 and RHCG-like2 genes, which were probably duplicated 
      in the lamprey lineage, are orthologs of gnathostome RHCG. In contrast, the clear 
      phylogenetic position of the RHBG-like gene could not be obtained. Probably some 
      convergent events for cyclostome RHBG-like genes prevented the accurate 
      identification of their phylogenetic positions.

TI  - Membrane-associated carbonic anhydrase in the respiratory system of the Pacific 
      hagfish (Eptatretus stouti).
PG  - 107-16
LID - 10.1016/j.resp.2009.02.005 [doi]
AB  - Like other agnathans, the Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stouti) lacks red blood cell 
      (RBC) Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchange. Despite this absence of anion exchange, the majority 
      (86.7+/-1.4%) of the total CO(2) carried in the blood is found within the plasma as 
      HCO(3)(-), and thus presumably is inaccessible to RBC carbonic anhydrase (CA). As 
      such, a branchial plasma-accessible CA isozyme in hagfish would be beneficial for 
      mobilizing the considerable plasma HCO(3)(-) stores for CO(2) excretion and blood 
      acid-base balance. The current study used a combination of molecular and biochemical 
      methods to identify two membrane-associated CA isozymes in the respiratory system of 
      E. stouti. Using homology cloning methods, CA IV and XV-like isozymes were 
      identified in the gill and RBC, respectively. Real-time PCR analysis of relative 
      mRNA expression revealed that CA IV was specific to the gill, while CA XV was found 
      in several tissues including the RBC, gill, liver, heart and muscle. Isolation of 
      subcellular fractions of gill and RBC verified the presence of membrane-associated 
      CA activity in each tissue that persisted after standard washing protocols. Unlike 
      CA activity associated with the cytoplasmic fractions, the activity in gill 
      membranes was not inhibited by sodium dodecyl sulphate, while RBC membrane activity 
      was inhibited to a lesser degree than the cytoplasmic fraction. Additionally, 
      incubation of gill membrane fractions with phosphatidylinositol-specific 
      phospholipase C released significant CA activity into the supernatant indicating the 
      presence of a glycophosphatidyl inositol-linkage to the membrane, as found with 
      other CA IV and XV isozymes. These results demonstrate that Pacific hagfish possess 
      gill and RBC plasma-accessible membrane-associated CA that may play important roles 
      in respiratory gas exchange and acid-base balance.

TI  - Immunoreactive endozepine-like peptides in the brain and pituitary of the Atlantic 
      hagfish, Myxine glutinosa.
PG  - 415-21
AB  - Endozepines are a family of peptides capable of displacing benzodiazepines from 
      their specific binding sites, to which belong the diazepam-binding inhibitor and the 
      octadecaneuropeptide (ODN). This paper reports the distribution of ODN-related 
      peptides, investigated for the first time by immunocytochemistry, in different brain 
      and pituitary regions of the Atlantic hagfish, Myxine glutinosa. Immunoreactive 
      ODN-like material was found in the telencephalon at the level of bundles of 
      different olfactory nerve fibres. Moreover, at the level of the pallium, 
      immunoreactive multipolar neurons were observed in the pars parvocellularis of the 
      stratum griseum superficialis. Similar immunopositive nerve cell bodies were found 
      in the nucleus medialis of the central prosencephalic complex. In the mesencephalon, 
      few immunoreactive neurons lining and contacting the mesencephalic ventricle were 
      detected; such nerve cells could be involved in the regulation of cerebrospinal 
      fluid homeostasis. Dorsally in the mesencephalon, numerous ODN-containing cell 
      bodies were present in the area praetectalis. The rhomboencephalon was immunostained 
      only in the octavolateral area and in the nucleus motorius magnocellularis of the 
      trigeminal nerve. Furthermore, ODN immunoreactivity was also present in the nerve 
      cells of ganglia of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve complex. The 
      immunocytochemical patterns described here in the brain of M. glutinosa suggest an 
      involvement of ODN-like peptides as neuromodulators in sensory pathways, such as 
      olfactory and visual. Finally, ODN-like substances were localized in discrete 
      populations of adenohypophysial cells and in tanycytes lining the neurohypophyseal 
      walls, suggesting for endozepines a paracrine and/or endocrine control of pituitary 
      hormones release and a neurohormone role respectively. These results could give new 
      insights into the chemioarchitecture of the brain of myxinoids.

TI  - X-ray scattering study of hagfish protease inhibitor, a protein structurally related 
      to complement and alpha 2-macroglobulin.
PG  - 7873-8
AB  - A protease inhibitor from hagfish blood plasma, homologous to human alpha 
      2-macroglobulin, has been studied in solution using small-angle X-ray scattering; 
      the radius of gyration, R, was found to be 7.0 nm, the molecular weight 340,000 +/- 
      20,000, and the largest distance within the molecule, Dmax, 22 nm. When the 
      inhibitor reacts with chymotrypsin, its 1:1 chymotrypsin complex is found to be more 
      compact than the native molecule, R = 6.1 nm. A very similar conformational change 
      is observed after the protein is reacted with methylamine. The data are consistent 
      with models consisting of two equal elliptic cylinders with the same size as the one 
      used as a model for the complement proteins C3 and C4 [cf. Osterberg et al. (1989) 
      Eur. J. Biochem. 183, 507-511]. In the model for the native protein, these cylinders 
      are arranged in an extended form, and in the one for the methylamine derivative (or 
      chymotrypsin complex), they are closer together so that the projection of their 
      elliptic surfaces forms an angle of about 70 degrees. These models for the hagfish 
      protease inhibitor were expanded to models for the twice as large human alpha 
      2-macroglobulin using symmetry operations, and the resulting alpha 2-macroglobulin 
      models were found to agree with those emerged from earlier studies involving 
      electron microscopy and X-ray scattering methods.

AB  - The distribution of cholinergic neurons is studied in the brains of cyclostomes 
      (Lampetra fluviatilis and Myxine glutinosa) representing an early stage of 
      vertebrate evolution. Histochemical localization of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is 
      complemented by quantitative determinations of acetylcholine (ACh), 
      cholinacetyltransferase (ChAT) and AChE. The determinations are carried out in 
      homogenates of whole brains, the brain regions telencephalon, diencephalon, 
      mesencephalon and medulla oblongata. The telencephalon is further subdivided and 
      studied in more detail.The transmitter distribution found in cyclostomes is compared 
      to data from other vertebrates. Observations on the ACh-distribution in the 
      telencephalon are discussed with the problems of identifying telencephalic 
      homologies.

TI  - CO2 transport properties of the blood of a primitive vertebrate, Myxine glutinosa 
      (L.).
PG  - 341-7
AB  - The CO2 transport properties of the blood of the hagfish, Myxine glutinosa are 
      markedly different from those previously demonstrated for the lamprey, Petromyzon 
      marinus. As in most other vertebrates, the majority of the CO2 in Myxine blood is 
      transported in the form of plasma bicarbonate. Erythrocyte bicarbonate does have 
      some access to the plasma in the blood of Myxine although the documented bicarbonate 
      movements were not sensitive to the chloride/bicarbonate exchange inhibitor, 
      4,4-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2-disulphonic acid (DIDS). The transmembrane pH 
      gradient in hagfish erythrocytes is also quite different from the gradient 
      previously demonstrated in other agnathans. As in other agnathans, significant 
      differences do occur between the distribution ratios for protons, chloride and 
      bicarbonate ions across the erythrocyte membrane, although the magnitude of these 
      differences is smaller in Myxine. Finally, the absence of pH-dependent changes in 
      erythrocyte water content appears to be a common feature of agnathan erythrocytes.

TI  - A conserved motif within the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase gene is widely 
      distributed across animal phyla.
PG  - 36245-9
AB  - The vitamin K-dependent gamma-glutamyl carboxylase catalyzes the posttranslational 
      conversion of glutamic acid to gamma-carboxyglutamic acid, an amino acid critical to 
      the function of the vitamin K-dependent blood coagulation proteins. Given the 
      functional similarity of mammalian vitamin K-dependent carboxylases and the vitamin 
      K-dependent carboxylase from Conus textile, a marine invertebrate, we hypothesized 
      that structurally conserved regions would identify sequences critical to this common 
      functionality. Furthermore, we examined the diversity of animal species that 
      maintain vitamin K-dependent carboxylation to generate gamma-carboxyglutamic acid. 
      We have cloned carboxylase homologs in full-length or partial form from the beluga 
      whale (Delphinapterus leucas), toadfish (Opsanus tau), chicken (Gallus gallus), 
      hagfish (Myxine glutinosa), horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus), and cone snail 
      (Conus textile) to compare these structures to the known bovine, human, rat, and 
      mouse cDNA sequences. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences identified a 
      nearly perfectly conserved 38-amino acid residue region in all of these putative 
      carboxylases. In addition, this amino acid motif is also present in the Drosophila 
      genome and identified a Drosophila homolog of the gamma-carboxylase. Assay of 
      hagfish liver demonstrated vitamin K-dependent carboxylase activity in this 
      hemichordate. These results demonstrate the broad distribution of the vitamin 
      K-dependent carboxylase gene, including a highly conserved motif that is likely 
      critical for enzyme function. The vitamin K-dependent biosynthesis of 
      gamma-carboxyglutamic acid appears to be a highly conserved function in the animal 
      kingdom.

TI  - Glomerular basement membrane and mesangial matrix: a comparative study in different 
      vertebrates.
PG  - 85-9
AB  - Perfusion fixation of the rat kidneys with aldehydes and alcian blue demonstrates 
      within the glomerular mesangium various components displaying anionic binding sites. 
      These are the surface coat of the mesangial cells, numerous mesangial microfibrils 
      (probably glycoproteins), and polygonal particles (Presumably proteoglycans). These 
      particles lie close to the mesangial cells and form assemblies of various extension 
      within the mesangial matrix as well. In addition, a discontinuous basement membrane 
      can be recognized which surrounds the mesangial cells. In the hagfish glomeruli 
      (fixed without cationic dye), a prominent layer of microfibrils is interposed 
      between mesangial and endothelial cells. Both these cells show incomplete basement 
      membranes.

TI  - Angiotensin I-converting enzyme-like activity in tissues from the Atlantic hagfish 
      (Myxine glutinosa) and detection of immunoreactive plasma angiotensins.
PG  - 357-64
AB  - Using a highly sensitive fluorimetric assay, significant levels of angiotensin I 
      -converting enzyme-like activity (ACELA) were detected in a range of tissues 
      (branchial heart, gill, kidney with associated vasculature and archinephric duct, 
      liver, whole brain and gut) from the Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa). The 
      highest ACELA occurred in heart and gill (1.8 and 1.5 nmol His-Leu min(-1) mg 
      protein(-1), respectively). The mammalian angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) 
      inhibitor, captopril, at 10(-5) M was a potent inhibitor of the ACELA found in all 
      hagfish tissues. Radioimmunoassay showed that immunoreactive angiotensins 
      (251.8+/-11.8 pM) were detectable in hagfish plasma. The validity of the assay for 
      measurement of hagfish angiotensins was indicated by the parallelism of the 
      angiotensin II standard curve against serially diluted hagfish plasma. Measurement 
      of immunoreactive plasma angiotensins and detection of significant levels of ACELA 
      in a wide range of tissues gives indirect evidence for the presence of a 
      renin-angiotensin system in hagfishes, the earliest evolved group of craniates.

TI  - Structural evolution of Otx genes in craniates.
PG  - 1668-78
AB  - Using a degenerate PCR approach, we performed an exhaustive search of Otx genes in 
      the reedfish Erpetoichthys calabaricus, the dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula, and the 
      hagfish Myxine glutinosa. Three novel Otx genes were identified in each of these 
      species, and their deduced protein sequences were determined over a large C-terminal 
      fragment located immediately downstream of the homeodomain. Like their lamprey and 
      osteichthyan counterparts, these nine genes display a tandem duplication of a 
      20--25-residue C-terminal domain, which appears to be a hallmark of all craniate Otx 
      genes identified thus far, including the highly divergent Crx gene. Phylogenetic 
      analyses show that, together with their osteichthyan counterparts, the dogfish and 
      reedfish genes can be classified into three gnathostome orthology classes. Two of 
      the three genes identified in each of these species belong to the Otx1 and Otx2 
      orthology classes previously characterized in osteichthyans. The third one 
      unambiguously clusters with the Otx5/Otx5b genes recently characterized in Xenopus 
      laevis, thus defining a novel orthology class. Our results also strongly suggest 
      that the highly divergent Crx genes identified in humans, rodents, and oxen are the 
      mammalian representatives of this third class. The hagfish genes display no clear 
      relationships to the three gnathostome orthology classes, but one of them appears to 
      be closely related to the LjOtxA gene, previously identified in Lampetra japonica. 
      Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that the Otx multigene families 
      characterized in craniates all derive from duplications of a single ancestral gene 
      which occurred after the splitting of cephalochordates but prior to the gnathostome 
      radiation. Using site-by-site sequence comparisons of the gnathostome Otx proteins, 
      we also identified structural constraints selectively acting on each of the three 
      gnathostome orthology classes. This suggests that specialized functions for each of 
      these orthology classes were fixed in the gnathostome lineage prior to the splitting 
      between osteichthyans and chondrichthyans.

TI  - Evolutionary studies on pancreatic colipase.
PG  - 340-5
AB  - In this evolutionary study the following criteria have been used to prove the 
      existence of colipase: 1. It restores the activity of human and porcine pancreatic 
      lipase inhibited by bile salt. 2. It cross-reacts with antisera to human and porcine 
      colipases. 3. Its restoration of lipase activity, inhibited by bile salt, in the 
      tributyrin assay system, is prevented by antiserum to colipase. 4. It is a 
      heat-stable, low-molecular-weight protein (molecular weight about 10 000 by 
      gel-filtration). The occurrence of colipase has been verified in the exocrine 
      pancreatic cells from hagfish (Myxine glutinosa), ratfish (Chimaera monstrosa), 
      rayfish (Raja radiata). Greenland shark (Somnius microcephalus) and dogfish (Squalus 
      acanthius). No colipase activity could be found in the gastric juice of crayfish 
      (Pacifastacus leniusculus). These results indicate that colipase envolved in the 
      vertebrates before the organized exocrine pancreatic gland and occurred 
      simultaneously with the bile salts/bile alcohols.

TI  - Evidence for bumetanide-sensitive, Na(+)-dependent, partial Na-K-Cl co-transport in 
      red blood cells of a primitive fish.
PG  - 588-91
AB  - Tracer uptake studies identified the major routes for K+ transport in hagfish red 
      cells, resolving them into ouabain-sensitive, loop diuretic-sensitive, and residual 
      components. The K1/2 values for ouabain, bumetanide, and furosemide were 10(-5), 6 x 
      10(-7), and 5 x 10(-6) M, respectively. The properties of the Na-K-Cl co-transporter 
      were investigated further by varying K+, Na+, and Cl- concentrations. The measured 
      K1/2 values were similar to those for human red cells. Finally, the stoichiometry of 
      Na:K:Cl uptake was determined, giving 1:1 for K+:Cl-; in contrast, no significant 
      Na+ flux could be measured, although Na+ content must be present for measurable 
      bumetanide-dependent K+ or Cl- flux to occur. The Na-K-Cl transport therefore shows 
      Na(+)-dependent KCl co-transport or partial flux of the system.

TI  - Immunolocalization of Na+/K(+)-ATPase in mitochondrion-rich cells of the atlantic 
      hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) gill.
PG  - 161-8
AB  - Using a monoclonal antibody for the alpha-subunit of the Na+/K(+)-ATPase, DASPEI (a 
      vital mitochondria dye), and confocal laser scanning microscopy, the presence of 
      Na+/K(+)-ATPase in mitochondrion-rich cells of the hagfish gill was confirmed. In 
      addition, the level of Na+/K(+)-ATPase expression in the hagfish gill was compared 
      to that of fishes with different osmoregulatory strategies (little skate, Raja 
      erinacea and mummichog, Fundulus heteroclitus). Immunocytochemistry detected a high 
      density of columnar cells expressing Na+/K(+)-ATPase in the afferent filamental 
      epithelium. Positive cells were also found in the lamellar epithelium but at a much 
      lower density. The distribution of DASPEI staining was similar to that of the 
      Na+/K(+)-ATPase antibody, indicating that the enzyme is expressed in 
      mitochondrion-rich cells. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the specificity of the 
      antibody for the 97 kDa alpha-subunit of the enzyme. The immunoreactive band 
      intensity for the Atlantic hagfish was similar to that of the little skate, but less 
      than half that of the full-strength seawater mummichog. These results are discussed 
      in relation to gill function in early craniates.

TI  - The hagfish slime gland thread cell. I. A unique cellular system for the study of 
      intermediate filaments and intermediate filament-microtubule interactions.
PG  - 653-69
AB  - Thread cell differentiation in the slime gland of the Pacific hagfish Eptatretus 
      stouti has been studied using light microscopy and scanning and transmission 
      electron microscopy. Thread cell differentiation is remarkable in that the life 
      history of the cell is largely dedicated to the production of a single, tapered, 
      cylindrical, highly coiled, and precisely packaged cytoplasmic thread that may 
      attain lengths of 60 cm and diameters approaching 1.5 micron. Each tapered thread, 
      in turn, is comprised almost entirely of large numbers of intermediate filaments 
      (IFs) bundled in parallel. During differentiation of the thread, the IFs become 
      progressively more tightly packed. Various numbers of microtubules (MTs) are found 
      among the bundled IFs during differentiation of the thread but disappear during the 
      latter stages of thread differentiation. Observations of regularly spaced dots in 
      longitudinal bisections of developing threads, diagonal striations in tangential 
      sections of developing threads, and circumferentially oriented, filament-like 
      structures observed at the periphery of developing threads cut in cross section have 
      led us to postulate a helically oriented component(s) wrapped around the periphery 
      of the developing thread. The enormous size of the fully differentiated thread cell, 
      its apparent singular dedication to the production of IFs, the ease of isolating and 
      purifying the threads and IF subunits (see accompanying paper), and the unique 
      position of the hagfish in the phylogenetic scheme of vertebrate evolution all 
      contribute to the attractiveness of the hagfish slime gland thread cell as a 
      potential model system for studying IF subunit synthesis, IF formation from IF 
      subunits, aggregation of IFs into IF bundles and the interaction(s) of IFs and MTs.

TI  - Presence of a member of the Tc1-like transposon family from nematodes and Drosophila 
      within the vasotocin gene of a primitive vertebrate, the Pacific hagfish Eptatretus 
      stouti.
PG  - 6798-802
AB  - Molecular cloning of the vasotocin gene of a cyclostome, the Pacific hagfish 
      Eptatretus stouti, reveals, in contrast to other known members of the vertebrate 
      vasopressin/oxytocin hormone gene family, an unusual exon-intron organization. 
      Although the location of three exons and two introns is conserved, an additional 
      intron is present 5' of the coding region of the hagfish gene. The third intron, 
      which is greater than 14 kilobase pairs in size, contains on the opposite DNA strand 
      to that encoding vasotocin an open reading frame exhibiting striking similarity to 
      the putative transposase of Tc1-like nonretroviral mobile genetic DNA elements, so 
      far reported only from nematodes and Drosophila. The hagfish element, called Tes1, 
      is flanked by inverted terminal repeats representing an example of the existence of 
      a typical inverted terminal-repeat transposon within vertebrates. The presence of 
      Tc1-like elements in nematodes, Drosophila, and cyclostomes indicates that these 
      genetic elements have a much broader phylogenetic distribution than hitherto 
      expected.

PG  - 121-30
LID - 10.1007/s00239-015-9701-0 [doi]
AB  - Lampreys and hagfish are the earliest diverging of extant vertebrates and are 
      obvious targets for investigating the origins of complex biochemical systems found 
      in mammals. Currently, the simplest approach for such inquiries is to search for the 
      presence of relevant genes in whole genome sequence (WGS) assemblies. Unhappily, in 
      the past a high-quality complete genome sequence has not been available for either 
      lampreys or hagfish, precluding the possibility of proving gene absence. Recently, 
      improved but still incomplete genome assemblies for two species of lamprey have been 
      posted, and, taken together with an extensive collection of short sequences in the 
      NCBI trace archive, they have made it possible to make reliable counts for specific 
      gene families. Particularly, a multi-source tactic has been used to study the 
      lamprey blood clotting system with regard to the presence and absence of genes known 
      to occur in higher vertebrates. As was suggested in earlier studies, lampreys lack 
      genes for coagulation factors VIII and IX, both of which are critical for the 
      "intrinsic" clotting system and responsible for hemophilia in humans. On the other 
      hand, they have three each of genes for factors VII and X, participants in the 
      "extrinsic" clotting system. The strategy of using raw trace sequence "reads" 
      together with partial WGS assemblies for lampreys can be used in studies on the 
      early evolution of other biochemical systems in vertebrates.

AB  - The native hagfish slime threads, which are made up of two intermediate filament 
      (IF)-like proteins, exhibit mechanical properties comparable to dragline spider silk 
      fiber, the toughest fiber in nature. However, unlike silk, the design of artificial 
      IF-protein-based fibers has been rarely studied, possibly because the unique 
      hierarchical organization of the keratin-like proteins within these threads is 
      challenging to mimic, and consequently, extraordinary fiber mechanics has not been 
      shown in slime threads from recombinant IF-protein-based system. Here, we have 
      reported the synthesis and properties of recombinant type V IF-protein, based on the 
      Caenorhabditis elegans (Ce) lamin gene. The protein was solubilized and wet-spun 
      into aqueous solutions to prepare Ce-lamin fibers by varying injection flow rates 
      and Ca(+2) ion concentrations in the coagulation buffer. At specific set of 
      conditions, Ce-lamin fibers demonstrated remarkable toughness and stiffness, 
      comparable to hagfish slime threads and natural dragline spider silk. Transmission 
      electron microscopy analysis showed that paracrystals were the main nanometric 
      structure within the fibers. This study demonstrates that outstanding mechanical 
      properties can be achieved with recombinant IF-proteins through self-organization. 
      Thus, these results have broadened the pool of fibrous proteins that can be used in 
      functional materials for a diverse range of applications.

TI  - Structural diversity of the hagfish variable lymphocyte receptors.
PG  - 6726-32
AB  - Variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) are recently discovered leucine-rich repeat 
      (LRR) family proteins that mediate adaptive immune responses in jawless fish. 
      Phylogenetically it is the oldest adaptive immune receptor and the first one with a 
      non-immunoglobulin fold. We present the crystal structures of one VLR-A and two 
      VLR-B clones from the inshore hagfish. The hagfish VLRs have the characteristic 
      horseshoe-shaped structure of LRR family proteins. The backbone structures of their 
      LRR modules are highly homologous, and the sequence variation is concentrated on the 
      concave surface of the protein. The conservation of key residues suggests that our 
      structures are likely to represent the LRR structures of the entire repertoire of 
      jawless fish VLRs. The analysis of sequence variability, prediction of protein 
      interaction surfaces, amino acid composition analysis, and structural comparison 
      with other LRR proteins suggest that the hypervariable concave surface is the most 
      probable antigen binding site of the VLR.

TI  - Actin-related intercellular adhesion junctions in the germinal compartment of the 
      testis in the hagfish (Eptatretus stouti) and lamprey (Lampetra tridentatus).
PG  - 450-9
AB  - The germinal epithelium of male vertebrates consists of Sertoli cells and 
      spermatogenic cells. Intercellular junctions formed by Sertoli cells assume critical 
      roles in the normal functions of this epithelium. While Sertoli cell junctions have 
      been well characterized in mammals, similar junctions in nonmammalian vertebrates 
      have received little attention. We examined the intercellular junctions found within 
      the germinal epithelium of the hagfish (Eptatretus stouti) and lamprey (Lampetra 
      tridentatus). Ultrastructurally, Sertoli cells were seen to form filament-associated 
      junctions in both species. Adjacent Sertoli cells formed microfilament-related 
      junctions near their apices. Filaments of these junctions were arranged in loose 
      networks and were not associated with cisterns of endoplasmic reticulum. In fixed, 
      frozen sections of hagfish testis, similar areas labeled with rhodamine phalloidin, 
      indicating the filament type is actin. In the lamprey, desmosomes were observed 
      immediately below the microfilament-related junctions. In appearance and location, 
      the Sertoli cell junctions observed in these species resembled those of the typical 
      junctional complex of other epithelial cell types. No junctions were observed 
      between Sertoli cells and elongating spermatids. In the hagfish, but not the 
      lamprey, an additional zone of microfilaments occurred near the base of Sertoli 
      cells in areas of association with the basal lamina. Our observations are consistent 
      with the proposal that the unique forms of intercellular attachment found in the 
      testes of higher vertebrates evolved from a typical epithelial form of intercellular 
      junction.

AB  - When onto- and phylogenetical aspects are taken into account when studying 
      insulin-producing islet-cell tumors, it becomes clear that the recently discovered 
      "type IV" islet parenchymal cells (or "delta 1" -cells) may play an important role 
      in various states of hypoglycemia, both of neoplastic and non-neoplastic origin. 
      Moreover, it becomes obvious that increased attention to this kind of islet cell 
      through intensified light-microscopical, histochemical, ultrastructural and 
      experimental investigations covering a wide range of animals, may help to clarify 
      several unsolved problems in the cytological composition of the islets of 
      Langerhans. The occurrence of islet-cell tumors (or hamartomas) in the most 
      primitive vertebrate islet parenchyma known, viz. that of the hagfish, Myxine 
      glutinosa, is reported, as well as an additional case of mixed carcinoid-islet-cell 
      tumor in a human pancreas.

TI  - Ultrastructure of the thread cells in the slime gland of Japanese hagfishes, 
      Paramyxine atami and Eptatretus burgeri.
PG  - 311-23
AB  - The thread cells in the slime gland of Japanese hagfishes, Paramyxine atami and 
      Eptatretus burgeri were studied by light and electron microscopy. The mature thread 
      cells are large elements (180 times 80 mu) filled with an intricately coiled thread, 
      approximately 2 mu in diameter. The protein nature of the thread has been confirmed 
      by histochemical examination. In the initial stage of growth, the thread consists of 
      a bundle of distinctly parallel filaments approximately 90-120 A in diameter and a 
      centrally located tubular component approximately 230-260 A in diameter which occurs 
      singly or occasionally as a double and triple structure. The developing thread 
      displays thin filaments, approximately 30-60 A in diameter. The thin filaments are 
      composed of fine fibrous structures, subfilaments, approximately 10-30 A in 
      diameter. On the outer surface of the thread a coating is apparent, giving it a 
      fluffy appearance. Polysomal clusters consisting of five or six ribosomes are 
      predominant. Fine fibrous structures are also found among the threads; they seem to 
      have a spatial relationship with the polysomes and resemble the subfilament 
      constituents of the thin filaments. From these results, it may be suggested that the 
      fine fibrous structures synthesized by polysomes, twist together and coalesce into a 
      thread. The problem of the polysome size and the molecular weight of the fibrous 
      protein synthesized is discussed.

AB  - In hagfish and lampreys, two representative jawless vertebrates, the humoral 
      immunity is directly mediated by variable lymphocyte receptors B (VLRBs). Both 
      monomeric VLRBs are structurally and functionally similar, but their C-terminal 
      tails differ: lamprey VLRB has a Cys-rich tail that forms disulfide-linked pentamers 
      of dimers, contributing to its multivalency, whereas hagfish VLRB has a 
      superhydrophobic tail of unknown structure. Here, we reveal that VLRBs obtained from 
      hagfish plasma have a globular-shaped multimerized form (approximately 0.6 to 1.7 
      MDa) that is generated by hydrophobic clustering instead of covalent linkage. 
      Electron microscopy (EM) and single-particle analysis showed that the multimerized 
      VLRBs form globular-shaped clusters with an average diameter of 28.7 ± 2.2 nm. The 
      presence of VLRBs in the complex was confirmed by immune-EM analysis using an 
      anti-VLRB antibody. Furthermore, the hydrophobic hagfish C-terminus (HC) was capable 
      of triggering multimerization and directing the cellular surface localization via a 
      glycophosphatidylinositol linkage. Our results strongly suggest that the hagfish 
      VLRB forms a previously unknown globular-shaped antibody. This novel identification 
      of a structurally unusual VLRB complex may suggest that the adaptive immune system 
      of hagfish differs from that of lamprey.

TI  - Characterization of Hagfish (Eptatretus burgeri) Variable Lymphocyte Receptor-Based 
      Antibody and Its Potential Role in the Neutralization of Nervous Necrosis Virus.
PG  - 718-725
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1900675 [doi]
AB  - The variable lymphocyte receptor (VLR) mediates the humoral immune response in 
      jawless vertebrates, including lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) and hagfish (Eptatretus 
      burgeri). Hagfish VLRBs are composed of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) modules, 
      conjugated with a superhydrophobic C-terminal tail, which contributes to low levels 
      of expression in recombinant protein technology. In this study, we screened 
      Ag-specific VLRBs from hagfish immunized with nervous necrosis virus (NNV). The 
      artificially multimerized form of VLRB was constructed using a mammalian expression 
      system. To enhance the level of expression of the Ag-specific VLRB, mutagenesis of 
      the VLRB was achieved in vitro through domain swapping of the LRR C-terminal cap and 
      variable LRR module. The mutant VLRB obtained, with high expression and secretion 
      levels, was able to specifically recognize purified and progeny NNV, and the Ag 
      binding ability of this mutant was increased by at least 250-fold to that of the 
      nonmutant VLRB. Furthermore, preincubation of the Ag-specific VLRB with NNV reduced 
      the infectivity of NNV in E11 cells in vitro, and in vivo experiment. Our results 
      suggest that the newly developed Ag-specific VLRB has the potential to be used as 
      diagnostic and therapeutic reagents for NNV infections in fish.

TI  - Degradation, receptor binding affinity, and potency of insulin from the Atlantic 
      hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) determined in isolated rat fat cells.
PG  - 602-8
AB  - Insulin from the Atlantic hagfish, Myxine glutinosa, a primitive vertebrate, was 
      studied with respect to degradation, receptor binding, and stimulation of glucose 
      transport and metabolism in isolated rat adipocytes. The degradation was studied in 
      a concentrated suspension with about 100mul of cells/ml of suspension. 125I-labeled 
      hagfish insulin and 125I-labeled pig insulin were degraded at the same rate when 
      present in concentrations of 0.3nM. Native hagfish insulin inhibited the rate of 
      degradation of 125I-labeled pig insulin half-maximally at a concentration of 12+/-2 
      nM (S.D., n=6) as compared to 130+/-32 nM (S.D.,n=6) for pig insulin. Native hagfish 
      insulin in a concentration of 130 nM was biologically inactivated at a rate several 
      times slower than pig insulin in the same concentration. The results indicate that 
      the maximal velocity (Vmax) of degradation of hagfish insulin as well as the 
      concentration causing half-maximal velocity (Km) are about 10 times lower for 
      hagfish insulin than for pig insulin. The receptor binding and the biological 
      effects of hagfish insulin were studied in dilute cell suspensions where the 
      degradation of hormone in the medium was negligible. The receptor binding affinity 
      of hagfish insulin was 23+/-7 per cent (S.D., n=10) of that of pig insulin. Hagfish 
      insulin was able to elicit the same maximal stimulation of both 3-o-methylglucose 
      exchange and lipogenesis from glucose as pig insulin. However, the potency of 
      hagfish insulin with respect to activation of lipogenesis was only 4.6+/-0.6 per 
      cent (S.D., n=15) of that of pig insulin. Hagfish insulin thus constitutes the first 
      described insulin which exhibits a discrepancy between relative binding affinity and 
      relative potency. This discrepancy was not due to the methionine residue (B31) at 
      the COOH-terminal end of the B chain of hagfish insulin, since removal of this 
      residue caused no marked change in the binding affinity or the potency. The results 
      indicate that the receptor occupancy must be 5 times higher with hagfish insulin 
      than with pig insulin to cause a particular degree of activation of lipogenesis. 
      Hagfish insulin might therefore be characterized as a "partial antagonist" on the 
      receptors. However, it was not possible to demonstrate antagonistic properties of 
      hagfish insulin on the cells. The effect of hagfish insulin plus pig insulin in 
      submaximally stimulating concentrations was additive. Furthermore, the decay of 
      activation of adipocytes after incubation with hagfish insulin followed the same 
      time course as the decay of activation after incubation with pig insulin in a 
      concentration of equal potency. These phenomena are in agreement with the concept 
      that adipocytes possess a large excess of receptors which can mediate the effect of 
      insulin on lipogenesis from glucose.

TI  - Intracellular and extracellular calcium utilization during hypoxic vasoconstriction 
      of cyclostome aortas.
PG  - R1506-13
AB  - Hypoxic vasoconstriction (HV) is an intrinsic response of mammalian pulmonary and 
      cyclostome aortic vascular smooth muscle. The present study examined the utilization 
      of calcium during HV in dorsal aortas (DA) from sea lamprey and New Zealand hagfish. 
      HV was temporally correlated with increased free cytosolic calcium (Ca2+c) in 
      lamprey DA. Extracellular calcium (Ca2+o) did not contribute significantly to HV in 
      lamprey DA, but it accounted for 38.1 +/- 5.3% of HV in hagfish DA. Treatment of 
      lamprey DA with ionomycin, ryanodine, or caffeine added to thapsigargin-reduced HV, 
      whereas HV was augmented by BAY K 8644. Methoxyverapamil (D600) in zero Ca2+o did 
      not affect HV in lamprey DA, nor did it prevent further constriction when Ca2+o was 
      restored during hypoxia in hagfish DA. Removal of extracellular sodium (Na+o) caused 
      a constriction in both species. Lamprey DA relaxed to prehypoxic tension following 
      return to normoxia in zero Na+o, whereas relaxation was inhibited in hagfish DA. 
      Relaxation following HV was inhibited in lamprey DA when Na+o and Ca2+o were 
      removed. These results show that HV is correlated with [Ca2+]c in lamprey DA and 
      that Na+/Ca2+ exchange is used during HV in hagfish but not lamprey DA. Multiple 
      receptor types appear to mediate stored intracellular calcium release in lamprey DA, 
      and L-type calcium channels do not contribute significantly to constriction in 
      either cyclostome.

TI  - Nucleoside uptake by red blood cells from a primitive vertebrate, the Pacific 
      hagfish (Eptatretus stouti), is mediated by a nitrobenzylthioinosine-insensitive 
      transport system.
PG  - 123-6
AB  - Red blood cells from the Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stouti) were found to possess a 
      facilitated diffusion nucleoside transport system insensitive to inhibition by the 
      nucleoside transport inhibitor nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR). Uridine uptake by 
      this route was saturable (apparent Km 0.14 mM; Vmax 2 mmol/l cells per h at 10 
      degrees C), inhibited by inosine and adenosine, and blocked both by the vasodilator 
      dipyridamole and by the thiol-reactive agent p-chloromercuriphenylsulphonate. The 
      properties of this carrier resemble closely those of NBMPR-insensitive nucleoside 
      transport systems in some mammalian neoplastic cell lines and in rat red cells. The 
      presence of this type of carrier in a primitive vertebrate suggests that such 
      transporters have a broad biological distribution and that they pre-date or arose at 
      an early stage of vertebrate evolution.

TI  - Immunoreactive atriopeptin in plasma of fishes: its potential role in gill 
      hemodynamics.
PG  - R939-45
AB  - With the use of antibodies raised against human atriopeptin (AP), immunoreactive AP 
      (APir) was quantified in the plasma of five species of marine fishes, including 
      members of the Agnatha, Chondrichthyes, and Osteichthyes. Concentrations of APir in 
      fish plasma are in the same range as those described for mammalian species, 
      indicating that AP was present in the earliest vertebrates and has retained at least 
      partial structural similarity during the course of vertebrate evolution. Acclimation 
      of two species to very dilute seawater was associated with a significant reduction 
      in plasma APir, suggesting that salt loading, rather than volume expansion, may be 
      the primary stimulus for AP release in fishes. Heterologous rat atriopeptin 
      (AP101-126) vasodilated preconstricted, perfused gills and unstimulated isolated 
      vascular rings from the ventral aorta of the marine teleost Opsanus beta with an 
      apparent half maximum effective concentration (EC50) of 3-4 x 10(-9) M, similar to 
      sensitivities to AP described for mammalian vascular smooth muscle. Acclimation of 
      toadfish to approximately 5% seawater (hyposmotic to plasma) did not alter the 
      sensitivity of the perfused gills but reduced the apparent EC50 of rat AP on aortic 
      rings to 3 x 10(-10) M. Extracts from O. beta atrium, ventricle, and brain also 
      produced dilation of aortic rings, with ventricular extracts producing the greatest 
      effect per milligram extracted tissue, suggesting that the ventricle may be a major 
      site source of atriopeptin in fishes. An atriopeptin-induced increase in blood flow 
      to the fish gill would theoretically have detrimental osmotic consequences, but may 
      stimulate salt transport, again suggesting that a putative atriopeptin may be 
      involved in salt, rather than osmotic, balance in fishes.

PG  - 173-83
AB  - In the mucosal epithelium of the digestive tract of two marine teleost bony fish, 
      one cartilaginous fish, one cyclostome, and in that of two of three representatives 
      of deuterostomian invertebrates studied, endocrine cells of open type were found, 
      exhibiting immunoreactivity with antisera against C-terminal sequences of mammalian 
      neurotensin and of the structurally closely related amphibian neurohormonal peptide 
      xenopsin. From these observations, and from those of previous studies, it is 
      suggested that neurotensin cells do not occur in the digestive tract mucosa until at 
      the evolutionary level of the more highly developed deutoerostomian invertebrates. 
      Three evolutionary stages seem to exist in the distribution pattern. The first 
      stage, characterized by few, widely scattered cells, is found in the uro- and 
      cephalochordates, the cyclostomes, the cartilaginous fish, and the stomachless bony 
      fish. In the second stage, comprising the remaining submammalian classes, including 
      more highly developed bony fish, the typical distribution pattern is that of 
      numerous neurotensin immunoreactive cells in the antrum, pylorus, and duodenum. The 
      final stage of neurotensin evolution is found in higher mammals and is characterized 
      by a great density of neurotensin immunoreactive cells in the ileum.

TI  - Molecular characterization of water-selective AQP (EbAQP4) in hagfish: insight into 
      ancestral origin of AQP4.
PG  - R644-51
AB  - Hagfish (Eptatretus burgeri) are agnathous and are the earliest vertebrates still in 
      existence. Pavement cells adjacent to the mitochondria-rich cells show orthogonal 
      arrays of particles (OAPs) in the gill of hagfish, a known ultrastructural 
      morphology of aquaporin (AQP) in mammalian freeze-replica studies, suggesting that 
      an AQP homolog exists in pavement cells. We therefore cloned water channels from 
      hagfish gill and examined their molecular characteristics. The cloned AQP [E. 
      burgeri AQP4 (EbAQP4)] encodes 288 amino acids, including two NPA motifs and six 
      transmembrane regions. The deduced amino acid sequence of EbAQP4 showed high 
      homology to mammalian and avian AQP4 (rat, 44%; quail, 43%) and clustered with AQP4 
      subsets by the molecular phylogenetic tree. The osmotic water permeability of 
      Xenopus oocytes injected with EbAQP4 cRNA increased eightfold compared with 
      water-injected controls and was not reversibly inhibited by 0.3 mM HgCl(2). EbAQP4 
      mRNA expression in the gill was demonstrated by the RNase protection assay; antibody 
      raised against the COOH terminus of EbAQP4 also detected (by Western blot analysis) 
      a major approximately 31-kDa band in the gill. Immunohistochemistry and 
      immunoelectron microscopy showed EbAQP4 localized along the basolateral membranes of 
      gill pavement cells. In freeze-replica studies, OAPs were detected on the 
      protoplasmic face of the split membrane comprising particles 5-6 nm long on the 
      basolateral side of the pavement cells. These observations suggest that EbAQP4 is an 
      ancestral water channel of mammalian AQP4 and plays a role in basolateral water 
      transport in the gill pavement cells.

TI  - Newly Discovered AqE Gene is Highly Conserved in Non-tetrapod Vertebrates.
PG  - 214-224
LID - 10.1007/s00239-021-09997-x [doi]
AB  - Studying the diversity of energy production pathways is important for understanding 
      the evolutionary relationships between metabolic pathways and their biochemical 
      precursors. The lactate/malate dehydrogenase (LDH/MDH) superfamily has been a model 
      system for structural and functional evolution for a long time. Recently, the type-2 
      family of LDH/MDH (or LDH2/MDH2 oxidoreductase) has been identified. The LDH2/MDH2 
      oxidoreductase family is now known to have functionally more diverse enzymes than 
      the LDH/MDH superfamily. In channel catfish, the gene encoding the LDH2/MDH2 
      oxidoreductase has been found (and was provisionally termed AqE). Homologs of this 
      enzyme are predominantly present in organisms living in an aquatic environment. In 
      this work, we studied the AqE gene distribution among non-tetrapod vertebrates. It 
      was found that the AqE gene is present in the genomes of bony and cartilaginous fish 
      and in the genomes of hagfishes and lampreys. In addition, it has been confirmed 
      that in representatives of Cypriniformes, the AqE gene has been lost. AqE in 
      representatives of Salmoniformes underwent significant deletions, which most likely 
      led to its pseudogenization. In most orders of non-Tetrapoda vertebrates, the AqE 
      gene remains highly conserved, suggesting that the AqE gene in aquatic vertebrates 
      is an essential gene and undergoes rigorous selection. The AqE gene has the highest 
      sequence similarity with the archaeal ComC gene that encodes sulfolactate 
      dehydrogenase (SLDH). Based on the similarity of substrates, the enzyme encoded by 
      the AqE gene is likely involved in the malate-aspartate shuttle mechanism or the 
      biosynthesis of the energy coenzyme M equivalent.

TI  - Changes in plasma catecholamine concentration during salinity manipulation and

PG  - 41-7
AB  - Plasma catecholamines were measured following surgery under anaesthesia and after 
      exposing hagfish to 90 and 110% sea water (SW). Plasma noradrenaline (NA) 
      concentration increased from a resting value of 7 to 818 nM l(-1) on anaesthesia. 
      Plasma adrenaline (AD) did not change. NA concentrations also increased during 
      volume depletion (110% SW), but to much lower values (26 nM l(-1 )at 100 min). AD 
      concentrations were increased at 20 min, then fell. During volume loading (90% SW) 
      NA fell, and AD increased to a maximum concentration of 511 nM l(-1) at 40 min 
      (resting concentration 24 nM l(-1)). The data are consistent with a vasoconstrictory 
      role for NA on central veins when venous pressures fall and a vasodilatory role for 
      AD on volume expansion.

TI  - Spontaneous unraveling of hagfish slime thread skeins is mediated by a 
      seawater-soluble protein adhesive.
PG  - 1263-8
LID - 10.1242/jeb.096909 [doi]
AB  - Hagfishes are known for their ability to rapidly produce vast quantities of slime 
      when provoked. The slime is formed via the interaction between seawater and two 
      components released by the slime glands: mucin vesicles from gland mucous cells, 
      which swell and rupture in seawater to form a network of mucus strands, and 
      intermediate filament-rich threads, which are produced within gland thread cells as 
      tightly coiled bundles called skeins. A previous study showed that the unraveling of 
      skeins from Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) requires both the presence of mucins 
      and hydrodynamic mixing. In contrast, skeins from Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus 
      stoutii) unravel in the absence of both mucins and mixing. We tested the hypothesis 
      that spontaneous unraveling of E. stoutii skeins is triggered by the dissolution of 
      a seawater-soluble protein adhesive and the release of stored strain energy within 
      the coiled thread. Here we show that, as predicted by this hypothesis, unraveling 
      can be initiated by a protease under conditions in which unraveling does not 
      normally occur. We also demonstrate, using high resolution scanning electron 
      microscopy, that the treatment of skeins with solutions that cause unraveling also 
      leads to the disappearance of surface and inter-thread features that remain when 
      skeins are washed with stabilizing solutions. Our study provides a mechanism for the 
      deployment of thread skeins in Pacific hagfish slime, and raises the possibility of 
      producing novel biomimetic protein adhesives that are salt, temperature and 
      kosmotrope sensitive.

AB  - Variable lymphocyte receptors B (VLRBs) are non-immunoglobulin components of the 
      humoral immune system in jawless vertebrates including hagfish (Eptatretus burgeri) 
      and lamprey (Petromyzon marinus). Hagfish VLRBs consist of leucine rich repeat (LRR) 
      modules with a superhydrophobic C-terminal tail, the latter of which leads to 
      extremely low expression levels in recombinant protein technology. Here, we present 
      an artificially oligomerized VLRB (arVLRB) that conjugates via the C4bp 
      oligomerization domain derived from human C4b-binding protein (hC4bp) rather than 
      the superhydrophobic tail. The resulting arVLRB had a tightly multimerized form with 
      seven monomeric VLRB arms and showed high expression and secretion levels in a 
      mammalian expression system. To isolate antigen-specific arVLRB, we constructed 
      large VLRB libraries from hagfish immunized with the fish pathogen, viral 
      hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV). The selected arVLRBs were found to recognize 
      various types of antigens, including the recombinant target protein, purified 
      viruses, and progeny viruses, with high antigen binding abilities and specificities. 
      We also performed in vitro affinity maturation of the arVLRBs through LRRCT 
      mutagenesis, and found that this enhanced their antigen-binding properties by at 
      least 125-fold. Our epitope mapping analysis revealed that (37)DWDTPL(42), which is 
      located in a region conserved among the glycoproteins of all VHSV isolates, is the 
      recognition epitope of the arVLRBs. Thus, our newly developed arVLRB could prove 
      useful in the development of universal diagnostic tools and/or therapeutic agents 
      for the virus. Together, our novel findings provide valuable insights into hagfish 
      VLRB and its potential use as a novel alternative to conventional antibodies for 
      biotechnological applications.

AB  - Transthyretin (TTR) is a vertebrate-specific protein involved in thyroid hormone 
      distribution in plasma, and its gene is thought to have emerged by gene duplication 
      from the gene for the ancient TTR-related protein, 5-hydroxyisourate hydrolase, at 
      some early stage of chordate evolution. We investigated the molecular and 
      hormone-binding properties of the brown hagfish Paramyxine atami TTR. The amino acid 
      sequence deduced from the cloned hagfish TTR cDNA shared 33-50% identities with 
      those of other vertebrate TTRs but less than 24% identities with those of vertebrate 
      and deuterostome invertebrate 5-hydroxyisourate hydrolases. Hagfish TTR, as well as 
      lamprey and little skate TTRs, had an N-terminal histidine-rich segment, allowing 
      purification by metal-affinity chromatography. The affinity of hagfish TTR for 
      3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) was 190 times higher than that for L-thyroxine, with 
      a dissociation constant of 1.5-3.9nM at 4°C. The high-affinity binding sites were 
      strongly sensitive to metal ions. Zn(2+) and Cu(2+) decreased the dissociation 
      constant to one-order of magnitude, whereas a chelator, o-phenanthroline, increased 
      it four times. The number of metal ions (mainly Zn(2+) and Cu(2+)) was approximately 
      12/TTR (mol/mol). TTR was also a major T3-binding protein in adult hagfish sera and 
      its serum concentration was approximately 8μM. These results suggest that metal ions 
      and the acquisition of N-terminal histidine-rich segment may cooperatively 
      contribute to the evolution toward an ancient TTR with high T3 binding activity from 
      either 5-hydroxyisourate hydrolase after gene duplication.

TI  - The unusual cartilaginous tissues of jawless craniates, cephalochordates and 
      invertebrates.
PG  - 165-74
AB  - A collagenous extracellular matrix was previously considered to be a requirement for 
      classification of true cartilage. Data from the lamprey and hagfish now clearly 
      indicate that both of these jawless craniates have extensive non-collagenous, yet 
      cartilaginous endoskeletons. Non-collagenous cartilages are present in the 
      cephalochordates (amphioxus) and in the invertebrates, although collagen-containing 
      cartilages also are found in the invertebrates. This review summarizes current 
      knowledge of the morphological, biochemical and molecular characteristics of the 
      unusual non-collagenous cartilages in jawless craniates and the cartilaginous 
      tissues in amphioxus and invertebrates. A least two types of non-collagenous 
      cartilage matrix proteins are found in both the hagfishes and the lampreys, all of 
      which are resistant to digestion by cyanogen bromide (CNBr). Although all four of 
      these matrices show some similarities with each other, suggesting a family of 
      non-collagenous, elastin-like proteins, it is clear that the major matrix proteins 
      of each are different. New morphological and biochemical information on the 
      cartilaginous tissues in squid, horseshoe crab and amphioxus reveals the presence of 
      CNBr-insoluble, non-collagenous matrix proteins, potentially extending the jawless 
      craniate family of cartilaginous proteins into the invertebrates. Details of the 
      evolutionary relationships between these non-collagenous matrix proteins and the 
      significance of the occurrence of these proteins as the major components of the 
      cartilaginous tissues of jawless craniates, amphioxus, horseshoe crab and squid, all 
      of which are capable of producing a variety of collagens in other tissues, remain to 
      be investigated.

TI  - The glomerular filtration barrier of the kidney in seven vertebrates classes. 
      Comparative morphological and histochemical observations.
PG  - 15-36
AB  - In the mammalian kidney, the glomerular filtration barrier (GFB) is mostly composed 
      of endothelial and epithelial cells with the glomerular basement membrane 
      interposed. In lower vertebrates, extensive regions of the GFB consist of the 
      endothelial and epithelial cells, each lying on its own basement membrane. These two 
      basement membranes border the mesangium, which contains mesangial cells (surrounded 
      by its own discontinuous basement membrane), microfibrils and collagens 
      (cross-striated fibrils, anchoring fibrils, and 5 nm interfibrillar filaments). 
      Occurrence and extension of these mesangial components decrease from fish to 
      mammals. Anionic binding sites associated with the different structures of the GFB 
      of all animal species have been demonstrated by using dyes such as Alcian blue (with 
      or without addition of electrolytes), Ruthenium red or Safranine O. The surface coat 
      of endothelial and epithelial cells, the laminae rarae (interna and externa) of the 
      glomerular basement membrane, the laminae rara and diffusa (wherever distinct 
      endothelial and epithelial basement membranes occurred) as well as the collagen 
      fibrils show particles (with polycationic dyes) or filaments (with monocationic 
      dyes). The mesangial microfibrils are usually well preserved and intensively 
      stained.

TI  - Q/R RNA editing of the AMPA receptor subunit 2 (GRIA2) transcript evolves no later 
      than the appearance of cartilaginous fishes.
PG  - 277-81
AB  - The amino acid, either a glutamine (Q) or an arginine (R), at the Q/R site of the 
      pore-lining segment (M2) of a vertebrate AMPA receptor subunit critically influences 
      the properties of the receptor. The R codon of the mammalian AMPA receptor subunit 2 
      (GRIA2) transcript is not coded by the chromosomal sequence, but is created by 
      posttranscriptional RNA editing activities. On the other hand, the R codons of some 
      teleost GRIA2 homologs are coded by chromosomal sequences. To elucidate the 
      evolution of the utilization of Q/R RNA editing in modifying vertebrate GRIA2 
      transcripts, the GRIA2 genes of five fish species and an amphibian were studied. The 
      putative hagfish GRIA2 homolog (hfGRIA2) encodes an R codon, whereas shark and 
      bullfrog GRIA2 genes specify a Q codon at the genomic Q/R site. All gnathostoma 
      GRIA2 genes possess an intron splitting the coding regions of M2 and the third 
      hydrophobic region (M3). The intronic components required for Q/R RNA editing are 
      preserved in all the Q-coding vertebrate GRIA2 genes but are absent from the 
      R-coding GRIA2 genes. Interestingly, the hfGRIA2 is intronless, suggesting that 
      hfGRIA2 is unlikely evolved from a Q/R editing-competent gene. Results of this study 
      suggest that modification of GRIA2 transcripts by Q/R editing is most likely 
      acquired after the separation of the Agnatha and Gnathostome.

TI  - Anticoagulant activity of dermatan polysulfates.
PG  - 359-65
AB  - It has been found that dermatan polysulfates (DPS) I, II and III isolated from 
      hagfish notochord, hagfish skin and shark skin, respectively, and chemically 
      sulfated dermatan sulfate exhibit considerable anticoagulant activity in the 
      "activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)" system. On comparing the activities 
      with the various compositions, including disaccharide units produced by the 
      digestion with chondroitinase-ABC, it was shown that the activity of these dermatan 
      polysulfates depends not only on the total sulfate content but also on the content 
      of sulfated L-iduronic acid residues. The activity seemed to decrease for molecular 
      weight of below 10,000. The effect of these dermatan polysulfates on th inactivation 
      of the clotting enzymes, factor Xa and thrombin, by antithrombin II (AT-III) was 
      also studied using chromogenic substrates for the assay of the enzyme activities. 
      The dermatan polysulfates showed an inhibitory effect on thrombin-AT-III, as 
      estimated by the APTT assay, in contrast with the effect on factor Xa-AT-III which 
      was found to be very small.

TI  - The main features of the craniate mitochondrial DNA between the ND1 and the COI 
      genes were established in the common ancestor with the lancelet.
PG  - 807-13
AB  - We have cloned the mitochondrial DNA fragment extending from tRNA-Leu to the 
      cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) genes of Branchiostoma lanceolatum, Myxine 
      glutinosa, Lampetra fluviatilis, and Scyliorhinus caniculus and have determined 
      their respective gene sequences and organization. In all four species, this region 
      contains the ND1 and ND2 genes and the genes coding eight tRNAs, namely, tRNA-Ile, 
      -Gln, -Met, -Trp, -Ala, -Asn, -Cys, and -Tyr. The gene order is the same in the 
      hagfish, lamprey and dogfish. In the lancelet, the location of the tRNA genes is 
      slightly different. The mitochondrial code of Myxine, Lampetra, and Scyliorhinus is 
      identical to that of vertebrates. The code used by the lancelet is the same with the 
      exception of AGA (a stop codon in vertebrates), which codes for glycine in the 
      lancelet. From the comparison of the four maps with already published ones for other 
      species, we propose that the main features of the craniate mtDNA between the ND1 and 
      COI genes were established in the common ancestor to cephalochordates and 
      vertebrates more than 400 MYA. The origin of replication of the light-strand 
      (Ori-L), usually located between the tRNA-Asn and tRNA-Cys genes in vertebrates, was 
      not found in the lancelet, hagfish, or lamprey (Lampetra). In contrast, it was found 
      in the dogfish. Thus the position of Ori-L was established for the first time in the 
      common ancestor to the Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes and remained present in all 
      later-emerging vertebrates.

AB  - Repeat proteins have recently been of great interest as potential alternatives to 
      immunoglobulin antibodies due to their unique structural and biophysical features. 
      We here present the development of a binding scaffold based on variable lymphocyte 
      receptors, which are nonimmunoglobulin antibodies composed of Leucine-rich repeat 
      modules in jawless vertebrates, by module engineering. A template scaffold was first 
      constructed by joining consensus repeat modules between the N- and C-capping motifs 
      of variable lymphocyte receptors. The N-terminal domain of the template scaffold was 
      redesigned based on the internalin-B cap by analyzing the modular similarity between 
      the respective repeat units using a computational approach. The newly designed 
      scaffold, termed "Repebody," showed a high level of soluble expression in bacteria, 
      displaying high thermodynamic and pH stabilities. Ease of molecular engineering was 
      shown by designing repebodies specific for myeloid differentiation protein-2 and hen 
      egg lysozyme, respectively, by a rational approach. The crystal structures of 
      designed repebodies were determined to elucidate the structural features and 
      interaction interfaces. We demonstrate general applicability of the scaffold by 
      selecting repebodies with different binding affinities for interleukin-6 using phage 
      display.

TI  - Hagfish C1q: its unique binding property.

AB  - Hagfish C1q (HaC1q) was identified and characterized as a pattern-recognition 
      molecule (PRM) in the hagfish complement system. The serum from hagfish, Eptatretus 
      burgeri, was applied to a GlcNAc-agarose column and eluted sequentially with GlcNAc 
      and EDTA. Four (31, 27, 26, and 19 kDa) and one (26 kDa) proteins were detected as 
      bound molecules in the GlcNAc- and the EDTA-eluates, respectively. Among these, the 
      26 kDa protein from the EDTA eluate was found to be a homologue of mammalian C1q 
      through cDNA analysis. HaC1q had an ability to bind to various microbes in a 
      Ca(2+)-dependent manner and its target ligands on the microbes were 
      lipopolysaccharide, lipoteichoic acid, and peptidoglycan. The binding of HaC1q to 
      GlcNAc-agarose was not inhibited by an excess amount of monosaccharide such as 
      GlcNAc. While HaC1q bound to Sepharose 6B with a matrix of GlcNAc-agarose (polymer 
      of agarobiose), it did not bind to Sepharose 4B that contained lower concentration 
      of agarobiose than Sepharose 6B. Therefore, the target of HaC1q on GlcNAc-agarose 
      was concluded to be agarobiose and high density of the target moiety seemed to be 
      required for the stable binding. This finding was in accordance with the known 
      behavior of other lectins involved in the complement system. We have concluded that 
      HaC1q recognizes agarobiose-like structures present on the surface of microbes and 
      acts as a pattern-recognition molecule in the process for elimination of invading 
      microbes.

TI  - Crystal structures of deoxy- and carbonmonoxyhemoglobin F1 from the hagfish 
      Eptatretus burgeri.
PG  - 21898-905
AB  - Hagfish are extremely primitive jawless fish of disputed ancestry. Although 
      generally classed with lampreys as cyclostomes ("round mouths"), it is clear that 
      they diverged from them several hundred million years ago. The crystal structures of 
      the deoxy and CO forms of hemoglobin from a hagfish (Eptatretus burgeri) have been 
      solved at 1.6 and 2.1 A, respectively. The deoxy crystal contains one dimer and two 
      monomers in a unit cell, with the dimer being similar to that found in lamprey 
      deoxy-Hb, but with a larger interface and different relative orientation of the 
      partner chains. Ile(E11) and Gln(E7) obstruct ligand binding in the deoxy form and 
      make room for ligands in the CO form, but no interaction path between the two hemes 
      could be identified. The BGH core structure, which forms the alpha1beta1 interface 
      of all vertebrate alpha2beta2 tetrameric Hbs, is conserved in hagfish and lamprey 
      Hbs. It was shown previously that human and cartilaginous fish Hbs have 
      independently evolved stereochemical mechanisms other than the movement of the 
      proximal histidine to regulate ligand binding at the hemes. Our results therefore 
      suggest that the formation of the alpha2beta2 tetramer using the BGH core and the 
      mechanism of quaternary structure change evolved between the branching points of 
      hagfish and lampreys from other vertebrates.

TI  - Protein tyrosine kinase cDNAs from amphioxus, hagfish, and lamprey: isoform 
      duplications around the divergence of cyclostomes and gnathostomes.
PG  - 601-8
AB  - Animals evolved a variety of gene families involved in cell-cell communication and 
      developmental control by gene duplication and domain shuffling. Each family is made 
      up of several subtypes or subfamilies with distinct structures and functions, which 
      diverged by gene duplications and domain shufflings before the divergence of 
      parazoans and eumetazoans. Since the separation from protostomes, vertebrates 
      expanded the multiplicity of members (isoforms) in the same subfamily by further 
      gene duplications in their early evolution before the fish-tetrapod split. To know 
      the dates of isoform duplications more closely, we have conducted isolation and 
      sequencing cDNAs encoding the fibroblast growth factor receptor, Eph, src, and 
      platelet-derived growth factor receptor subtypes belonging to the protein tyrosine 
      kinase family from Branchiostoma belcheri, an amphioxus, Eptatretus burgeri, a 
      hagfish, and Lampetra reissneri, a lamprey. From a phylogenetic tree of each 
      subfamily inferred from a maximum likelihood (ML) method, together with a bootstrap 
      analysis based on the ML method, we have shown that the isoform duplications 
      frequently occurred in the early evolution of vertebrates around or just before the 
      divergence of cyclostomes and gnathostomes by gene duplications and possibly 
      chromosomal duplications.

TI  - Sperm nuclear basic proteins (SNBPs) of agnathans and chondrichthyans: variability 
      and evolution of sperm proteins in fish.
PG  - 422-31
AB  - We have characterized for the first time SNBPs from the hagfish Eptatratus stouti 
      (Myxini) and the lamprey Lampetra tridentatus (Cephalaspidomorphi) and have found 
      that histones are the major protein components of the sperm of these agnathans. We 
      have also conducted a systematic analysis of SNBPs from different groups of 
      chondrichthyan fishes, including the skate Raja rhina and seven species of sharks. 
      Together with our previous data showing the sporadic nature of SNBP evolution in 
      bony fish (Saperas, N., Ausio, J., Lloris, D. and Chiva, M. [1994] J. Mol. Evol. 39: 
      282-295), the present study provides a unique insight into the overall evolutionary 
      complexity and variability of the nuclear sperm proteins of fishes. It would appear 
      that despite the discontinuous evolution of these proteins, the macroevolutionary 
      pattern of histone (H type) --> protamine-like (PL type) --> protamine (P type) has 
      been conserved in fish evolution, as it has in the evolution of other Deuterostomes.

TI  - An unusual intermediate filament subunit from the cytoskeletal biopolymer released 
      extracellularly into seawater by the primitive hagfish (Eptatretus stouti).
PG  - 3133-44
AB  - Each slime gland thread cell from the primitive Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stouti) 
      contains a massive, conical, intermediate filament (IF)-rich biopolymer ('thread,' 
      approximately 60 cm length, approximately 3 microns width). In view of the unusual 
      ultrastructure of the thread, its extracellular role in modulation of the 
      viscoelastic properties of mucus, and the ancient lineage of this primitive 
      vertebrate, we report the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of one major 
      thread IF subunit, alpha (pI 7.5), which is coexpressed with a second polypeptide, 
      gamma (pI 5.3). These two polypeptides coassemble in vitro into approximately 10 nm 
      filaments. The alpha-thread chain, a 66.6 kDa polypeptide, has an unusual central 
      rod domain containing 318 residues flanked by N- and C-terminal domains of 192 and 
      133 residues, respectively. Each peripheral region exhibits some epidermal 
      keratin-like features including peptide repeats and a high total content of glycine 
      and serine residues. The terminal domains, however, lack the H1 and H2 subdomains 
      characteristic of known keratins. Moreover, when the central rod is aligned either 
      in relation to established homology profiles (J. F. Conway and D. A. D. Parry (1988) 
      Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 10, 79-98) of other IF subunits (types I-V, nestin, 
      non-neuronal invertebrate), or by computer-based homology searches of the 
      GenBank/EMBL Data Bank, a low identity (< 30%) is evident, with no preferred 
      identity to keratins or other known IF types. Although the central rod of 318 
      residues consists of the canonical apolar heptad repeats interspersed with three 
      linker regions, a discontinuity in phasing of the heptad substructure in rod 2B, and 
      conserved sequences at either end of the rod domain, other collective 
      characteristics are atypical: overall high threonine content (13.2% vs 2.3-5.4% for 
      other IFs), high threonine content in rod 1B (18.8% vs 1-6%), five Thr-Thr repeats 
      in coiled coil segments, L12 of length greater than in keratins, substitution of 
      phenylalanine for a highly conserved glutamate in the sixth position of L2, and a 
      glycine-proline sequence in segment 2B. Possibly as a result of the high threonine 
      content, the percentage of both acidic and basic residues in most helical subdomains 
      is reduced relative to type I and II chains. Fast Fourier transform analyses show 
      that only the acidic residues in segment 1B and basic residues in segment 2 have 
      near typical IF periods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - Ultrastructural visualization of cross-linked protein features in epidermal 
      appendages.
PG  - 1985-92
AB  - Upon vigorous extraction with ionic detergent under reducing conditions, the 
      macroscopic structures of mammalian hair, bird feather and horny teeth of the 
      hagfish become swollen and flexible but were substantially preserved. In each case, 
      removal in this way of solubilizable constituents, such as disulfide-bonded keratins 
      and associated matrix proteins, left a residue of epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)lysine 
      cross-linked protein. Residual features in hair included cell envelopes in the 
      cortex, cell envelopes and intracellular deposits in the medulla, and nearly the 
      entire cuticle cells. In feather, extraction left largely intact the macroscopic 
      barb structures but caused collapse of the rachis. In both rachis and barbs, 
      considerable material resembling cell envelopes remained. In extracted hagfish teeth 
      the cellular organization was clearly visible microscopically, including cell 
      borders and remnant nuclei. Unlike the cornified envelopes of mature epidermal 
      keratinocytes, which appear as doublets, reflecting their formation immediately 
      beneath each plasma membrane of apposing cells, the borders of cells of hair cortex 
      and hagfish teeth appeared single and continuous from one cell to the next. Thus the 
      observed cross-linked features comprised four types: (i) condensation immediately 
      beneath the plasma membrane (feather, hair medulla and cuticle) similar to cornified 
      envelopes of epidermal keratinocytes; (ii) deposition between cells (hair cortex, 
      horny teeth); (iii) cytoplasmic deposits (hair cuticle and medulla); and (iv) 
      nuclear condensation (hair medulla, horny teeth). The results emphasize the 
      importance of transglutaminases and their substrate proteins for the function of 
      epidermal appendages and may provide a useful diagnostic test for perturbation of 
      their normal structures.

AB  - The variable lymphocyte receptor B (VLRB) of jawless vertebrates has a similar 
      function to the antibodies produced by jawed vertebrates, and has been considered as 
      an alternative source to mammalian antibodies for use in biological research. We 
      developed a modified yeast display vector system (pYD8) to display recombinant 
      hagfish VLRB proteins on the extracellular surface of yeast for the isolation of 
      antigen-specific VLRBs. After observing an up-regulation in the VLRB response in 
      hagfish immunized with hemagglutinin 1 of avian influenza virus H9N2 subtype 
      (H9N2-HA1), the antigen-specific VLRBs decorated on the yeast's surface were 
      selected by quantitative library screening through magnetic-activated cell sorting 
      (MACS) and fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS). We also demonstrated a strong 
      specificity of the antigen-specific VLRBs, when expressed as a secreted protein 
      using a mammalian expression system. Together, our findings suggest that the pYD8 
      vector system could be useful for screening antigen-specific hagfish VLRBs, and the 
      specificity of secreted VLRB may have potential for a variety of biological 
      applications.

AB  - Two different adaptive immune systems (AIS) are present in the two phyla of 
      vertebrates (jawed vertebrates and cyclostomes). The jawed vertebrate system is 
      based on IG/TCR/RAG/MHC while the cyclostome system is based on VLRCs and AID-like 
      enzymes both systems using homologous Cell types (B-cell and B-cell Like, T-cell and 
      T-cell like). We will present our current view of the evolution of these two AISs 
      and present alternative hypotheses that could explain the apparent convergent 
      evolution of the two systems. We will also discuss why comparative immunology 
      analyses should be based on evolutionary biology approaches and not on the scale of 
      progress one.

TI  - Peroxisomal beta-oxidation: insights from comparative biochemistry.
PG  - 267-73
AB  - The activities of fatty acyl-CoA oxidase (FAO) and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 
      (CPT), indices of the capacities of peroxisomal beta-oxidation and mitochondrial 
      beta-oxidation, respectively, were determined in livers of several vertebrate 
      species notable for differences in dietary fatty acid composition. In suckling rats 
      FAO activities were half that in adult rats and CPT/FAO ratios twice that of adult 
      rats. As their milk diet is dominated by medium chain fatty acids, this observation 
      is consistent with current ideas about the role of peroxisomal beta-oxidation in rat 
      liver in oxidation of long chain unsaturated fatty acids. In nectar-feeding 
      hummingbirds (fatty acids synthesized de novo) FAO activities were 50% greater than 
      adult rats and CPT/FAO ratios one-third less than adult rats, suggesting that 
      peroxisomal beta-oxidation is relatively more important in this species, despite a 
      fatty-acid-poor diet. In marine fish (herring, dogfish shark, hagfish) FAO 
      activities were all less than 15% that of rats and undetectable in hagfish. CPT/FAO 
      ratios were greater in herring (8.1) and hagfish (greater than 30) than adult rats 
      (3.1), suggesting that peroxisomal beta-oxidation is relatively less important in 
      these species despite a natural diet containing high levels of long chain 
      polyunsaturated fatty acids. These data are discussed in relation to current ideas 
      about the role of peroxisomes in beta-oxidation of fatty acids.

TI  - [Chromatin diminution at the border of the XX and XXI centuries].
PG  - 379-97
AB  - The size of genomes in eukaryotic organisms is one of the greatest mysteries of 
      biology. As known from the middle of the XX century, the level of organization of a 
      particular organism, does not depend on its genome size, i. e. on DNA amount in the 
      nucleus. We believe that an actual function of non-coding DNA stands behind the 
      phenomenon of chromatin diminution, known already for 100 years. Diminution of 
      chromatin normally takes place in cells involved in body building and never occurs 
      in developmental precursors of germ cells. Apparently, the former are cells, in 
      which non-coding DNA is functionally significant. We cloned a fraction of DNA 
      eliminated during chromatin diminution of Cyclops kolensis (Cyclopoida, Crustascea) 
      and sequenced 90 clones totally making 32 kb. Taken together, the provided evidence 
      has demonstrated a high organization ordering of DNA sequences restricted to the 
      germ line. Chromatin diminution never takes place in human cells and in cells of the 
      majority of animals. These cells may isolate non-coding DNA in other ways, making it 
      unreactable for most enzymes and thus functionally cut off. Thus, a certain part of 
      genome with a particular size and structure may serve for genetic isolation of 
      species as shellfish or junk DNA are vital components rather than pieces of garbage.

AB  - Since hagfishes are considered the most primitive vertebrate known, extant or 
      extinct, studies on their reproduction are indispensable for understanding 
      phylogenetic aspects of vertebrate reproduction. However, little information is 
      available on the endocrine regulation of the gonadal function in the hagfish. Based 
      on EST analysis of the testis of the brown hagfish (Paramyxine atami), P450 side 
      chain cleavage (CYP11A), which is the first and essential enzyme for steroidogenesis 
      in jawed vertebrates, was cloned. The deduced amino acid sequence of hagfish CYP11A 
      shows high identity to other animal forms especially in two functional domains, 
      adrenodoxin binding domain and heme-binding domain. In the phylogenetic analysis, 
      hagfish CYP11A forms a clade with the vertebrate CYP11A. Following the real-time PCR 
      analysis, CYP11A mRNA expression levels were clearly correlated to the developmental 
      stages of gonads in both sexes of the brown hagfish. By in situ hybridization, 
      CYP11A mRNA signals were found in the theca cells of the ovarian follicles and 
      Leydig cells and the tubule-boundary cells of the testis. These molecular and 
      histological evidences are suggesting that CYP11A plays functional roles as a 
      steroidogenic enzyme in gonadal development. Moreover, native GTH purified from 
      hagfish pituitary stimulated the transcriptional levels of CYP11A in the 
      organ-cultured testis in vitro, clearly suggesting that the steroidogenic activity 
      of the hagfish is under the control of the pituitary GTH. It is suggested that 
      vertebrates, during their early evolution, have established the pituitary-gonadal 
      reproductive system.

      and spectacle caiman.
PG  - 99-105
AB  - 1. Owing to interest in the original function and evolution of cytochrome P-450 this 
      enzyme system was studied in four species each at different levels on the 
      phylogenetic tree, representing Agnatha, Selachi, Teleostei, and Reptilia. 2. All 
      species contained considerable amounts of hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450. The 
      content in dogfish, perch and spectacle caiman was 0.2-0.3 while in the dogfish it 
      was 0.6 nmol per mg protein. 3. Hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 dependent 
      ethylmorphine demethylase, benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylase, 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase 
      and 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activities have been measured and the assays were 
      carefully characterized with respect to pH-, protein content-, incubation time- and 
      temperature-activity relationships. 4. The study revealed species-dependent 
      differences in the liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 enzyme system, which could be 
      due to differences in cytochrome P-450 composition or in the microenvironment around 
      the enzyme.

TI  - Immunoreactive endothelin in plasma of nonmammalian vertebrates.
PG  - S414-6
AB  - Immunoreactive endothelin (ir-ET) was estimated in plasma of nonmammalian 
      vertebrates, using radioimmunoassay (RIA) for endothelin-1 (ET-1). Blood samples 
      were collected from unanesthetized animals. Plasma ET was determined by RIA after 
      extraction. Plasma levels of ir-ET were 0.7 +/- 0.2 pg/ml (n = 6) in the hagfish 
      Eptatretus burgeri, 4.3 +/- 0.9 pg/ml (n = 5) in the banded dogfish Triakis scyllia, 
      3.6 +/- 0.8 pg/ml (n = 3) in the common Japanese conger Conger myriaster, 9.6 +/- 
      1.4 pg/ml (n = 7) in the carp Cyprinus carpio, 6.4 +/- 0.8 pg/ml (n = 5) in the 
      bullfrog Rana catesbeiana, 6.7 +/- 0.6 pg/ml (n = 3) in the soft-shelled turtle 
      Trionyx sinensis japonica, and 3.3 +/- 0.6 pg/ml (n = 8) in the Japanese quail 
      Coturnix coturnix japonica. The dilution curves of the plasma extracts from each 
      species almost paralleled the standard curve for ET-1. Analysis of the plasma 
      extracts of the carp by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography 
      revealed that ir-ET consisted of three components, a predominant peak being located 
      at the elution position of synthetic ET-1. The present results demonstrate clearly 
      that an ET-1-like substance circulates in blood of nonmammalian vertebrates, 
      suggesting an endocrine function of the peptide in these species.

TI  - Monophyly of lampreys and hagfishes supported by nuclear DNA-coded genes.
PG  - 729-35
AB  - The phylogenetic position of hagfishes in vertebrate evolution is currently 
      controversial. The 18S and 28S rRNA trees support the monophyly of hagfishes and 
      lampreys. In contrast, the mitochondrial DNAs suggest the close association of 
      lampreys and gnathostomes. To clarify this controversial issue, we have conducted 
      cloning and sequencing of the four nuclear DNA-coded single-copy genes encoding the 
      triose phosphate isomerase, calreticulin, and the largest subunit of RNA polymerase 
      II and III. Based on these proteins, together with the Mn superoxide dismutase for 
      which hagfish and lamprey sequences are available in database, phylogenetic trees 
      have been inferred by the maximum likelihood (ML) method of protein phylogeny. It 
      was shown that all the five proteins prefer the monophyletic tree of cyclostomes, 
      and the total log-likelihood of the five proteins significantly supports the 
      cyclostome monophyly at the level of +/-1 SE. The ML trees of aldolase family 
      comprising three nonallelic isoforms and the complement component group comprising 
      C3, C4, and C5, both of which diverged during vertebrate evolution by gene 
      duplications, also suggest the cyclostome monophyly.

AB  - It is now well established that peptides that were first identified on the basis of 
      their ability to inhibit growth of bacteria and fungi are multifunctional and so are 
      more informatively described as host-defense peptides. In some cases, their role in 
      protecting the organism against pathogenic microorganisms, although of importance, 
      may be secondary. A previous article in the journal (Peptides 2014; 57:67-77) 
      assessed the potential of peptides present in the skin secretions of frogs for 
      development into anticancer, antiviral, immunomodulatory and antidiabetic drugs. 
      This review aims to extend the scope of this earlier article by focusing upon 
      therapeutic applications of host-defense peptides present in skin secretions and/or 
      skin extracts of species belonging to other vertebrate classes (Agnatha, 
      Elasmobranchii, Teleostei, Reptilia, and Mammalia as represented by the human) that 
      supplement their potential role as anti-infectives for use against 
      multidrug-resistant microorganisms.

TI  - Gonadotropin-like and adrenocorticotropin-like cells in the pituitary gland of 
      hagfish, Paramyxine atami; immunohistochemistry in combination with lectin 
      histochemistry.
PG  - 563-72
AB  - The pituitary system of the hagfish remains an enigma. The present study has aimed 
      to detect possible adenohypophysial hormones in the pituitary gland of the brown 
      hagfish, Paramyxine atami, by means of immunohistochemistry in combination with 
      lectin histochemistry. Rabbit antisera raised against ovine luteinizing hormone 
      (LH)beta, proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-related peptides, and the growth 
      hormone/prolactin family of tetrapod and fish species were used, and 25 kinds of 
      lectins were tested. Three different types of adenohypophysial cells were revealed 
      in the pituitary of brown hagfish. The first was stained with both anti-ovine LH 
      beta and several D-mannose-binding lectins, such as Lens culinaris agglutinin and 
      Pisum sativum agglutinin. This cell type predominated in the adenohypophysis in 
      adults with developing gonads and thus appeared to be involved in the regulation of 
      gonadal functions. The second was negative for anti-ovine LH beta but was stained 
      with several N-acetylglucosamine-binding lectins, such as wheat germ agglutinin and 
      Lycopersicon esculentum lectin. This cell type exhibited a weak positive reaction 
      with anti-lamprey adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and thus appeared to be related to 
      POMC-like cells. The second cell type was found in the adenohypophysis regardless of 
      the developmental state of the gonads. The third cell type was negative for both 
      antisera and lectins. Since this cell type was numerous in juveniles and adults 
      without developing gonads, most cells of this type were probably undifferentiated. 
      These findings suggest that GTH and ACTH are major adenohypophysial hormones in the 
      hagfish.

TI  - Hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system in hagfish: localization of neurophysin-, 
      arg-vasopressin- and oxytocin-like immunoreactivity.
PG  - 289-96
AB  - Serial paraffin sections of hagfish brain (Eptatretus burgeri) were 
      immunocytochemically examined for porcine neurophysin (NEU), arg-vasopressin (AVP) 
      and oxytocin (OT). A big number of NEU-immunoreactive nerve cells were visible in 
      the frontal part of the ventromedial hypothalamus in close vicinity of the third 
      ventricle. These cells were bipolar in most cases and sometimes additionally stained 
      for AVP but not for OT. NEU-reactive neurons extended axons to the median eminence 
      and the posterior lobe of the pituitary which also contained AVP or OT-like 
      immunoreactivity. Immunostaining outside the hypothalamus could not be observed. It 
      is likely that there exists a mammalian-like oxytocinergic and a vasopressinergic 
      hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system in hagfish, despite the large differences in 
      levels of organization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Protein three-dimensional structures are very much important in terms of 
      functional and evolutionary context. In the present work we evaluated the snake 
      venom constituent cytotoxin, short neurotoxin and related non-toxin proteins of 
      other chordates with reference to structure prediction, validation of the models, 
      distribution of secondary structural elements, hydrophobicity molecular surface 
      analysis, functional annotation and functionally critical binding site 
      identification with the assistance of different bioinformatical tools. METHODS: 
      Homology models have been generated with the help of Swiss-model and ITASSER suite 
      during the present study. Afterwards the refined structural models were validated 
      with standard methods. For functional annotation of protein molecules we used 
      Protein Information Resource (PIR) database. The functionally critical amino acids 
      and ligand- binding site (LBS) of the proteins (modeled) was determined using the 
      COACH program. RESULTS: Structural analysis of snake venom toxin proteins and 
      related non-toxin proteins of other chordates elucidated their structural level 
      conservation of molecular structural surfaces and biophysical characteristics to 
      different extents. Different structural level improvement strategies were observed 
      which are necessary for better system dependent adaptation to diverse biological 
      environment and functional necessities of these protein molecules. CONCLUSION: 
      Molecular models and their structural characterization of these proteins as 
      documented in this study may provide a valuable aid for drug designing in future.

TI  - Long-term inheritance of the 28S rDNA-specific retrotransposon R2.
PG  - 2157-65
AB  - R2 is a non-long-terminal-repeat (LTR) retrotransposon that inserts specifically 
      into 28S rDNA. R2 has been identified in many species of arthropods and three 
      species of chordates. R2 may be even more widely distributed in animals, and its 
      origin may be traceable to early animal evolution. In this study, we identified R2 
      elements in medaka fish, White Cloud Mountain minnow, Reeves' turtle, hagfish, sea 
      lilies, and some arthropod species, using degenerate polymerase chain reaction 
      methods. We also identified two R2 elements from the public genomic sequence 
      database of the bloodfluke Schistosoma mansoni. One of the two bloodfluke R2 
      elements has two zinc-finger motifs at the N-terminus; this differs from other known 
      R2 elements, which have one or three zinc-finger motifs. Phylogenetic analysis 
      revealed that the whole phylogeny of R2 can be divided into 11 parts (subclades), in 
      which the local R2 phylogeny and the corresponding host phylogeny are consistent. 
      Divergence-versus-age analysis revealed that there is no reliable evidence for the 
      horizontal transfer of R2 but supports the proposition that R2 has been vertically 
      transferred since before the divergence of the deuterostomes and protostomes. The 
      seeming inconsistency between the R2 phylogeny and the phylogeny of their hosts is 
      due to the existence of paralogous lineages. The number of N-terminal zinc-finger 
      motifs is consistent with the deep phylogeny of R2 and indicates that the common 
      ancestor of R2 had three zinc-finger motifs at the N-terminus. This study revealed 
      the long-term vertical inheritance and the ancient origin of sequence specificity of 
      R2, both of which seem applicable to some other non-LTR retrotransposons.

TI  - Localisation and characteristics of natriuretic peptide receptors in the gills of 
      the Atlantic hagfish Myxine glutinosa (Agnatha).
PG  - 117-26
AB  - Specific binding of iodinated natriuretic peptides 125I-ANP and 125I-CNP was 
      examined in the gill of the Atlantic hagfish Myxine glutinosa by tissue section 
      autoradiography, saturation and competition analysis of binding to membrane 
      preparations, affinity cross-linking, followed by SDS-PAGE and guanylate cyclase 
      assays. Autoradiographs showed specific, saturable binding on the respiratory 
      lamellar epithelium. In vitro analysis of the binding sites demonstrated that 
      125I-ANP bound to two receptor sites with the same affinity (Kd = 15.4 +/- 1.6 pmol 
      l-1; Bmax = 45.9 +/- 3.0 fmol mg-1 protein). 125I-CNP bound to high- and 
      low-affinity receptor sites; variables for the high-affinity site (Kd = 12.9 +/- 4.7 
      pmol l-1; Bmax = 23.4 +/- 6.5 fmol mg-1 protein) did not differ from those for the 
      125I-ANP sites. The low-affinity site had an apparent Kd and Bmax of 380 +/- 80 pmol 
      l-1 and 120 +/- 21 fmol mg-1 protein, respectively. All receptors had an apparent 
      molecular mass of approximately 150 kDa, with no indication of a mammalian type 
      NPR-C at a lower apparent molecular mass. 1 nmol l-1 unlabelled rANP and 20 and 30 
      nmol l-1 unlabelled pCNP and C-ANF, respectively, competed for 50% of 125I-ANP 
      sites. 0.1 nmol l-1 rANP and pCNP and 8 nmol l-1 C-ANF competitively inhibited 50% 
      of 125I-CNP binding. Both rANP and pCNP stimulated cyclic GMP production, although 
      rANP was a more potent stimulator than was pCNP. C-ANF did not stimulate cyclic GMP 
      production. These data suggest the existence of an ANP guanylate-cyclase-linked 
      receptor similar to the mammalian NPR-A and an ANP/CNP receptor that may be similar 
      to, although not structurally homologous with, the mammalian NPR-C clearance 
      receptor.

TI  - [Evolution of monoamine receptors and the origin of motivational and emotional 
      systems in vertebrates].
PG  - 1505-14; discussion 1515-6
AB  - The evolving vertebrate nervous system was accompanied by major gene duplication 
      events generating novel organs and a sympathetic system. Vertebrate neural pathways 
      synthesizing catecholamine neurotransmitters (dopamine and noradrenaline), were 
      subsequently recruited to process increased information demands by mediating 
      psychomotor functions such as selective attention/predictive reward and emotional 
      drive via the activation of multiple G-protein linked catecholamine receptor 
      subtypes. Here we show that the evolution of these receptor-mediated events were 
      similarly driven by forces of gene duplication, at the cephalochordate/vertebrate 
      transition. In the cephalochordate Amphioxus, a sister group to vertebrates, a 
      single catecholamine receptor gene was found, which based on molecular phylogeny and 
      functional analysis formed a monophyletic group with both vertebrate dopamine D1 and 
      beta adrenergic receptor classes. In addition, the presence of dopamine but not of 
      noradrenaline was assayed in Amphioxus. In contrast, two distinct genes homologous 
      to jawed vertebrate dopamine D1 and beta adrenergic receptor genes were extant in 
      representatives of the earliest craniates, lamprey and hagfish, paralleling high 
      dopamine and noradrenaline content throughout the brain. These data suggest that a 
      D1/beta receptor gene duplication was required to elaborate novel catecholamine 
      psychomotor adaptive responses and that a noradrenergic system specifically emerged 
      at the origin of vertebrate evolution.

TI  - Alcohol dehydrogenase class III contrasted to class I. Characterization of the 
      cyclostome enzyme, the existence of multiple forms as for the human enzyme, and 
      distant cross-species hybridization.
PG  - 1081-8
AB  - Alcohol dehydrogenases of classes I (the classical liver enzyme) and III 
      (formaldehyde dehydrogenase) constitute a pair of moderately related enzymes (63% 
      residue identity between the human forms) that differ fundamentally in many 
      respects. To elucidate the nature of the differences, we have characterized alcohol 
      dehydrogenase from the most primitive vertebrate line (a cyclostome, Atlantic 
      Hagfish), related that to the multiplicity of the human enzyme, and submitted the 
      enzymes to in vitro hybridization for evaluation of subunit interactions. Three 
      findings illustrate important principles of the enzyme system. First, the alcohol 
      dehydrogenase purified from cyclostomes is a class-III protein, compatible with the 
      facts that cyclostomes constitute the earliest extant vertebrate line and that class 
      III has a distant pre-vertebrate origin. Second, the hagfish enzyme shows 
      multiplicity, with acidic forms in decreasing yield and with amino acid sequences 
      identical between two major isoforms, both aspects constituting properties similar 
      to those of the corresponding human forms. The chemically different subunits are 
      present as homodimers and heterodimers of unmodified and modified subunits, 
      suggesting that the class-III multiplicity derives from modification of a type 
      common to lines as divergent as mammals and cyclostomes. Third, the human enzyme can 
      form cross-species hybrid dimers in vitro with the cod and hagfish or Drosophila 
      class-III enzymes (positional identity with the human form of 82, 76 and 70%, 
      respectively). Hence, the results provide experimental evidence for little class-III 
      divergence in the segments of subunit interactions. The extent of conservation of 
      residues directly involved in the formation of the subunit interface also reveals a 
      clearly different pattern between classes I and III. This highlights separation of 
      divergent forms in an enzyme system, with the constant form (class III) resembling 
      house-keeping enzymes, and exhibiting a correlation between subunit-interacting and 
      substrate-interacting segments.

TI  - Oxygen-dependence of metabolic rate in the muscles of craniates.
PG  - 715-29
LID - 10.1007/s00360-010-0455-0 [doi]
AB  - We present evidence that oxygen consumption (VO2) is oxygen partial pressure 
      (PO2)dependent in striated muscles and PO2-independent in the vasculature in 
      representatives of three craniate taxa: two teleost fish, a hagfish and a rat. Blood 
      vessel VO2 displayed varying degrees of independence in a PO2 range of 15-95 mmHg, 
      while VO2 by striated muscle tissue slices from all species related linearly to PO2 
      between 0 and 125 mmHg, despite VO2 rates varying greatly between species and muscle 
      type. In salmon red muscle, lactate concentrations fell in slices incubated at a PO2 
      of either 30 or 100 mmHg, suggesting aerobic rather than anaerobic metabolism. 
      Consistent with this finding, potential energy, a proxy of ATP turnover, was 
      PO2-dependent. Our data suggest that the reduction in VO2 with falling PO2 results 
      in a decrease in ATP demand, suggesting that the hypoxic signal is sensed and 
      cellular changes effected. Viability and diffusion limitation of the preparations 
      were investigated using salmon cardiac and skeletal muscles. Following the initial 
      PO2 depletion, reoxygenation of the Ringer bathing salmon cardiac muscle resulted in 
      VO2S that was unchanged from the first run. VO2 increased in all muscles uncoupled 
      with p-trifluoromethoxylphenyl-hydrazone (FCCP) and 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP). 
      Mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase activity, quantified by reduction of 
      3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) to formazan, was 
      constant over the course of the experiment. These three findings indicate that the 
      tissues remained viable over time and ruled out diffusion-limitation as a constraint 
      on VO2.

TI  - Comparative analysis of nitrite uptake and hemoglobin-nitrite reactions in 
      erythrocytes: sorting out uptake mechanisms and oxygenation dependencies.
PG  - R972-82
LID - 10.1152/ajpregu.00813.2009 [doi]
AB  - Nitrite uptake into red blood cells (RBCs) precedes its intracellular reactions with 
      hemoglobin (Hb) that forms nitric oxide (NO) during hypoxia. We investigated the 
      uptake of nitrite and its reactions with Hb at different oxygen saturations (So(2)), 
      using RBCs with (carp and rabbit) and without (hagfish and lamprey) anion 
      exchanger-1 (AE1) in the membrane, with the aim to unravel the mechanisms and 
      oxygenation dependencies of nitrite transport. Added nitrite rapidly diffused into 
      the RBCs until equilibrium. The distribution ratio of nitrite across the membrane 
      agreed with that expected from HNO(2) diffusion and AE1-mediated facilitated 
      NO(2)(-) diffusion. Participation of HNO(2) diffusion was emphasized by rapid 
      transmembrane nitrite equilibration also in the natural AE1 knockouts. Following the 
      equilibration, nitrite was consumed by reacting with Hb, which created a continued 
      inward diffusion controlled by intracellular reaction rates. Changes in nitrite 
      uptake with So(2), pH, or species were accordingly explained by corresponding 
      changes in reaction rates. In carp, nitrite uptake rates increased linearly with 
      decreasing So(2) over the entire So(2) range. In rabbit, nitrite uptake rates were 
      highest at intermediate So(2), producing a bell-shaped relationship with So(2). 
      Nitrite consumption increased approximately 10-fold with a 1 unit decrease in pH, as 
      expected from the involvement of protons in the reactions with Hb. The reaction of 
      nitrite with deoxyhemoglobin was favored over that with oxyhemoglobin at 
      intermediate So(2). We propose a model for RBC nitrite uptake that involves both 
      HNO(2) diffusion and AE1-mediated transport and that explains both the present and 
      previous (sometimes puzzling) results.

TI  - Variable lymphocyte receptors in hagfish.
PG  - 9224-9
AB  - A previously uncharacterized type of variable lymphocyte receptors (VLR) was 
      identified recently in the Sea lamprey. This jawless vertebrate generates an 
      extensive VLR repertoire through differential insertion of neighboring diverse 
      leucine-rich repeat (LRR) cassettes into an incomplete germ-line VLR gene. We report 
      here VLR homologs from two additional lamprey species and the presence of two types 
      of VLR genes in hagfish, the only other order of contemporary jawless vertebrates. 
      As in the Sea lamprey, the incomplete hagfish germ-line VLR-A and -B genes are 
      modified in lymphocyte-like cells to generate highly diverse repertoires of VLR-A 
      and -B proteins via a presently undetermined mechanism. This jawless-fish mode of 
      VLR diversification starkly contrasts with the rearrangement of Ig V(D)J gene 
      segments used by all jawed vertebrates to produce diverse repertoires of T and B 
      lymphocyte antigen receptors. The development of two very different strategies for 
      receptor diversification at the dawn of vertebrate evolution approximately 500 
      million years ago attests to the fitness value of a lymphocyte-based system of 
      anticipatory immunity.

AB  - The variable lymphocyte receptor (VLR) B of jawless vertebrates functions as a 
      secreted Ab of jawed vertebrates and has emerged as an alternative Ab with a single 
      polypeptide chain. After observing an upregulated VLRB response in hagfish immunized 
      with avian influenza virus (AIV) subtype H9N2, we screened AIV H9N2-specific VLRB 
      using a mammalian expression system. To improve the binding avidity of the 
      Ag-specific VLRB to the Ag, we enabled multimerization of the VLRB by conjugating it 
      with C-terminal domain of human C4b-binding protein. To dramatically enhance the 
      expression and secretion of the Ag-specific VLRB, we introduced a glycine-serine 
      linker and the murine Ig κ leader sequence. The practical use of the Ag-specific 
      VLRB was also demonstrated through various immunoassays, detected by anti-VLRB Ab 
      (11G5). Finally, we found that the Ag-specific VLRB decreased the infectivity of AIV 
      H9N2. Together, our findings suggest that the generated Ag-specific VLRB could be 
      used for various immunoapplications.

TI  - Fabrication of nanofibrous scaffold using a PLA and hagfish thread keratin 
      composite; its effect on cell adherence, growth, and osteoblast differentiation.
PG  - 045006
LID - 10.1088/1748-6041/8/4/045006 [doi]
AB  - Electrospinning is a useful method for the production of nanofibrous scaffolds in 
      the field of tissue engineering. Keratin has been used as a biomaterial for 
      electrospinning and can be used in a variety of biomedical applications because it 
      is a natural protein, giving it the ability to improve cell affinity of scaffolds. 
      In this study, keratin was extracted from hagfish slime thread (H-keratin) and 
      blended with polylactic acid (PLA) polymer solution to construct a nanofibrous 
      scaffold. Wool keratin (W-keratin) was used as a control for the comparison of 
      morphological, physical, and biological properties. The results of Fourier transform 
      infrared spectroscopy showed the presence of both W-keratin and H-keratin in the 
      electrospun PLA/keratin. Observations with a scanning electron microscope revealed 
      that PLA, PLA/W-keratin, and PLA/H-keratin had similar average diameters (~800 nm). 
      Cell attachment experiments showed that MG-63 cells adhered more rapidly and spread 
      better onto PLA/H-keratin than onto the pure PLA or PLA/W-keratin. Cell 
      proliferation assay, DNA content, live/dead, and alkaline phosphatase activity 
      assays showed that PLA/H-keratin scaffolds could accelerate the viability, 
      proliferation, and osteogenesis of MG-63 cells relative to pure PLA or PLA/W-keratin 
      nanofibrous scaffolds. These findings suggest that H-keratin can improve cellular 
      attraction and has great potential to be used as a biomaterial in bone tissue 
      engineering.

TI  - Gene duplications and losses within the cyclooxygenase family of teleosts and other 
      chordates.
PG  - 2349-59
LID - 10.1093/molbev/msn183 [doi]
AB  - Cyclooxygenase (COX) produces prostaglandins in animals via the oxidation and 
      reduction of arachidonic acid. Different types and numbers of COX genes have been 
      found in corals, sea squirts, fishes, and tetrapods, but no study has used a 
      comparative phylogenetic approach to investigate the evolutionary history of this 
      complex gene family. Therefore, to examine COX evolution in the teleosts and 
      chordates, 9 novel COX sequences (possessing residues and domains critical to COX 
      function) were acquired from the euryhaline killifish, longhorn sculpin, sea 
      lamprey, Atlantic hagfish, and amphioxus using standard polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) and cloning methods. Phylogenetic analyses of these and other COX sequences 
      show a complicated history of COX duplications and losses. There are three main 
      lineages of COX in the chordates corresponding to the three subphyla in the phylum 
      Chordata, with each lineage representing an independent COX duplication. Hagfish and 
      lamprey most likely have traditional COX-1/2 genes, suggesting that these genes 
      originated with the first round of genome duplication in the vertebrates according 
      to the 2R hypothesis and are not exclusively present in the gnathostomes. All 
      teleosts examined have three COX genes due to a teleost-specific genome duplication 
      followed by variable loss of a COX-1 (in the zebrafish and rainbow trout) or COX-2 
      gene (in the derived teleosts). Future studies should examine the functional 
      ramifications of these differential gene losses.

TI  - A fast algorithm for determining the best combination of local alignments to a query 
      sequence.
PG  - 62
AB  - BACKGROUND: Existing sequence alignment algorithms assume that similarities between 
      DNA or amino acid sequences are linearly ordered. That is, stretches of similar 
      nucleotides or amino acids are in the same order in both sequences. Recombination 
      perturbs this order. An algorithm that can reconstruct sequence similarity despite 
      rearrangement would be helpful for reconstructing the evolutionary history of 
      recombined sequences. RESULTS: We propose a graph-based algorithm for combining 
      multiple local alignments to a query sequence into the single combination of 
      alignments that either covers the maximal portion of the query or results in the 
      single highest alignment score to the query. This algorithm can help study the 
      process of genome rearrangement, improve functional gene annotation, and reconstruct 
      the evolutionary history of recombined proteins. The algorithm takes O(n2) time, 
      where n is the number of local alignments considered. CONCLUSIONS: We discuss two 
      example applications of the algorithm. The algorithm is able to provide useful 
      reconstructions of the metazoan mitochondrial genome. It is also able to increase 
      the percentage of a query sequence's amino acid residues for which similar stretches 
      of amino acids can be found in sequence databases.

TI  - Opsin-immunoreactive outer segments of photoreceptors in the eye and in the lumen of 
      the optic nerve of the hagfish, Myxine glutinosa.
PG  - 515-22
AB  - Opsin-immunoreactive sites in the eye and optic nerve of the hagfish, Myxine 
      glutinosa, were studied by use of light-microscopic pre- and postembedding 
      peroxidase-antiperoxidase or avidin-biotin-peroxidase techniques, and the 
      immuno-electron-microscopic protein A-gold method. At the light-microscopic level, a 
      strong opsin immunoreaction was obtained on the outer segments of the photoreceptor 
      cells with sheep and rat antibodies against bovine (rhod)opsin. These outer segments 
      were located in the marginal photoreceptor space and in follicles of the retina, as 
      well as in the tubular lumen of the optic nerve. Ultrastructurally, two classes of 
      outer segments can be distinguished; most of them exhibited a strong antiopsin 
      reaction, while certain elements lacked immunoreactivity with the antisera employed. 
      The protein A-gold particles marked opsin-immunoreactive sites on the photoreceptor 
      membranes. The presence of opsin-immunoreactive material in the retina and optic 
      nerve of the hagfish strengthens the view that this primitive eye lacking a cornea, 
      lens and vitreous body is engaged in light perception. The morphological similarity 
      between the eye and pineal tissue is discussed in connection with the absence of a 
      pineal organ in this species.

PG  - 1139-47
AB  - The chemistry and physiology of calcitonin are reviewed with particular emphasis on 
      the evolution of the hormone and its modern role in humans. It seems likely that the 
      relative deficiency of calcitonin in women may be important in postmenopausal bone 
      loss. A major therapeutic application of calcitonin is in the treatment of Paget's 
      disease of bone, and current recommendations for therapy are presented.

TI  - Cation and harmaline interactions with Na(+)-independent dibasic amino acid 
      transport system y+ in human erythrocytes and in erythrocytes from a primitive 
      vertebrate the pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stouti).
PG  - 111-8
AB  - Transport systems y+, asc and ASC exhibit dual interactions with dibasic and neutral 
      amino acids. For conventional Na(+)-dependent neutral amino acid system ASC, side 
      chain amino and guanido groups bind to the Na+ site on the transporter. The 
      topographically equivalent recognition site on related system asc binds harmaline (a 
      Na(+)-site inhibitor) with the same affinity as asc (apparent Ki range 1-4 mM), but 
      exhibits no detectable affinity for Ha. Although also classified as 
      Na(+)-independent, dibasic amino acid transport system y+ accepts neutral amino 
      acids when Na+ or another acceptable cation is also present. This latter observation 
      implies that the y+ translocation site binds Na+ and suggests possible functional 
      and structural similarities with ASC/asc. In the present series of experiments with 
      human erythrocytes, system y(+)-mediated lysine uptake (5 microM, 20 degrees C) was 
      found to be 3-fold higher in isotonic sucrose medium than in normal 150 mM NaCl 
      medium. This difference was not a secondary consequence of changes in membrane 
      potential, but resulted from Na+ functioning as a competitive inhibitor of 
      transport. Apparent Km and Vmax values for lysine transport at 20 degrees C were 
      15.2 microM and 183 mumol/l cells per h, respectively, in sucrose medium and 59.4 
      microM and 228 mumol/l cells per h in Na+ medium. Similar results were obtained with 
      y+ in erythrocytes of a primitive vertebrate, the Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus 
      stouti), indicating that Na(+)-inhibition is a general property of this class of 
      amino acid transporter. At a permeant concentration of 5 microM, the IC50 value for 
      Na(+)-inhibition of lysine uptake by human erythrocytes was 27 mM. Other inorganic 
      and organic cations, including K+ and guanidinium+, also inhibited transport. In 
      parallel with its actions on ASC/asc harmaline competitively inhibited lysine uptake 
      by human cells in sucrose medium. As predicted from mutually competitive binding to 
      the y+ translocation site, the presence of 150 mM Na+ increased the harmaline 
      inhibition constant (Ki) from 0.23 mM in sucrose medium to 0.75 mM in NaCl medium. 
      We interpret these observations as further evidence that y+, asc and ASC represent a 
      family of closely related transporters with a common evolutionary origin.

TI  - Identification of amino acid residues responsible for the pyrimidine and purine 
      nucleoside specificities of human concentrative Na(+) nucleoside cotransporters 
      hCNT1 and hCNT2.
PG  - 24475-84
AB  - hCNT1 and hCNT2 mediate concentrative (Na(+)-linked) cellular uptake of nucleosides 
      and nucleoside drugs by human cells and tissues. The two proteins (650 and 658 
      residues, 71 kDa) are 72% identical in sequence and contain 13 putative 
      transmembrane helices (TMs). When produced in Xenopus oocytes, recombinant hCNT1 is 
      selective for pyrimidine nucleosides (system cit), whereas hCNT2 is selective for 
      purine nucleosides (system cif). Both transport uridine. We have used (i) chimeric 
      constructs between hCNT1 and hCNT2, (ii) sequence comparisons with a newly 
      identified broad specificity concentrative nucleoside transporter (system cib) from 
      Eptatretus stouti, the Pacific hagfish (hfCNT), and (iii) site-directed mutagenesis 
      of hCNT1 to identify two sets of adjacent residues in TMs 7 and 8 of hCNT1 
      (Ser(319)/Gln(320) and Ser(353)/Leu(354)) that, when converted to the corresponding 
      residues in hCNT2 (Gly(313)/Met(314) and Thr(347)/Val(348)), changed the specificity 
      of the transporter from cit to cif. Mutation of Ser(319) in TM 7 of hCNT1 to Gly 
      enabled transport of purine nucleosides, whereas concurrent mutation of Gln(320) to 
      Met (which had no effect on its own) augmented this transport. The additional 
      mutation of Ser(353) to Thr in TM 8 converted hCNT1/S319G/Q320M, from cib to cif, 
      but with relatively low adenosine transport activity. Additional mutation of 
      Leu(354) to Val (which had no effect on its own) increased the adenosine transport 
      capability of hCNT1/S319G/Q320M/S353T, producing a full cif-type transporter 
      phenotype. On its own, the S353T mutation converted hCNT1 into a transporter with 
      novel uridine-selective transport properties. Helix modeling of hCNT1 placed 
      Ser(319) (TM 7) and Ser(353) (TM 8) within the putative substrate translocation 
      channel, whereas Gln(320) (TM 7) and Leu(354) (TM 8) may exert their effects through 
      altered helix packing.

TI  - Atlantic hagfish cardiac muscle: metabolic basis of tolerance to anoxia.
PG  - R356-62
AB  - Oxygen tensions in the major venous inputs to the systemic and portal-vein hearts of 
      normoxic Atlantic hagfish (12.3 +/- 1.7 and 11.0 +/- 1.6 mmHg, respectively) are low 
      compared with typical vertebrate values. Anoxia and poisoning with cyanide and azide 
      do not significantly affect in situ performance of the systemic heart. Idoacetate 
      poisoning, however, results in a significant decrease in cardiac performance of the 
      systemic heart to 12% of the initial value after 3 h. Activities of mitochondrial 
      enzymes of hagfish ventricle suggest a small potential for aerobic metabolism 
      compared with those in the aerobic ventricle of Atlantic cod. Activities of enzymes 
      of carbohydrate metabolism indicate similar anaerobic capacity in hagfish and cod 
      ventricle. The ratio of pyruvate kinase to cytochrome c oxidase, an index of 
      anaerobic to aerobic capacity, is 5.6 times greater in hagfish than cod ventricle. 
      Metabolite concentrations in freeze-clamped ventricles of normoxic and hypoxic 
      hagfish indicate hypoxia-induced activation of glycogenolysis, enhanced substrate 
      flow across 6-phosphofructokinase, and an apparent secondary constriction of 
      glycolysis at the level of glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase. Carbohydrate 
      utilization via the glycolytic pathway appears essential for maintenance of cardiac 
      performance in both normoxic and anoxic hagfish. Under conditions of severe hypoxia, 
      ATP provision is probably met by anaerobic glycolysis.

      and binding activities for growth factors and neurotrophic factors.
PG  - 50799-809
AB  - Oversulfated chondroitin sulfate (CS)/dermatan sulfate (DS) hybrid chains were 
      purified from the notochord of hagfish. The chains (previously named CS-H for 
      hagfish) have an average molecular mass of 18 kDa. Composition analysis using 
      various chondroitinases demonstrated a variety of D-glucuronic acid (GlcUA)- and 
      L-iduronic acid (IdoUA)-containing disaccharides variably sulfated with a higher 
      proportion of GlcUA/IdoUA-GalNAc 4,6-O-disulfate, revealing complex CS/DS hybrid 
      features. The hybrid chains showed neurite outgrowth-promoting activity of an axonic 
      nature, which resembled the activity of squid cartilage CS-E and which was abolished 
      fully by chondroitinase ABC digestion and partially by chondroitinase AC-I or B 
      digestion, suggesting the involvement of both GlcUA and IdoUA in neuritogenic 
      activity. Purified CS-H exhibited interactions in a BIAcore system with various 
      heparin-binding proteins and neurotrophic factors (viz. fibroblast growth factor-2, 
      -10, -16, and -18; midkine; pleiotrophin; heparin-binding epidermal growth 
      factor-like growth factor; vascular endothelial growth factor; brain-derived 
      neurotrophic factor; and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor), most of which 
      are expressed in the brain, although fibroblast growth factor-1 and ciliary 
      neurotrophic factor showed no binding. Kinetic analysis revealed high affinity 
      binding of these growth factors and, for the first time, of the neurotrophic 
      factors. Competitive inhibition revealed the involvement of both IdoUA and GlcUA in 
      the binding of these growth factors, suggesting the importance of the hybrid nature 
      of CS-H for the efficient binding of these growth factors. These findings, together 
      with those from the recent analysis of brain CS/DS chains from neonatal mouse and 
      embryonic pig (Bao, X., Nishimura, S., Mikami, T., Yamada, S., Itoh, N., and 
      Sugahara, K. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 9765-9776), suggest physiological roles of 
      the hybrid chains in the development of the brain.

TI  - Identification of extant vertebrate Myxine glutinosa VWF: evolutionary conservation 
      of primary hemostasis.
PG  - 2548-2558
LID - 10.1182/blood-2017-02-770792 [doi]
AB  - Hemostasis in vertebrates involves both a cellular and a protein component. Previous 
      studies in jawless vertebrates (cyclostomes) suggest that the protein response, 
      which involves thrombin-catalyzed conversion of a soluble plasma protein, 
      fibrinogen, into a polymeric fibrin clot, is conserved in all vertebrates. However, 
      similar data are lacking for the cellular response, which in gnathostomes is 
      regulated by von Willebrand factor (VWF), a glycoprotein that mediates the adhesion 
      of platelets to the subendothelial matrix of injured blood vessels. To gain 
      evolutionary insights into the cellular phase of coagulation, we asked whether a 
      functional vwf gene is present in the Atlantic hagfish, Myxine glutinosa We found a 
      single vwf transcript that encodes a simpler protein compared with higher 
      vertebrates, the most striking difference being the absence of an A3 domain, which 
      otherwise binds collagen under high-flow conditions. Immunohistochemical analyses of 
      hagfish tissues and blood revealed Vwf expression in endothelial cells and 
      thrombocytes. Electron microscopic studies of hagfish tissues demonstrated the 
      presence of Weibel-Palade bodies in the endothelium. Hagfish Vwf formed 
      high-molecular-weight multimers in hagfish plasma and in stably transfected CHO 
      cells. In functional assays, botrocetin promoted VWF-dependent thrombocyte 
      aggregation. A search for vwf sequences in the genome of sea squirts, the closest 
      invertebrate relatives of hagfish, failed to reveal evidence of an intact vwf gene. 
      Together, our findings suggest that VWF evolved in the ancestral vertebrate 
      following the divergence of the urochordates some 500 million years ago and that it 
      acquired increasing complexity though sequential insertion of functional modules.

TI  - Phylogeny of a neural cell adhesion molecule.
PG  - 39-46
AB  - The phylogeny of adhesion among cells derived from neural tissue has been examined 
      using a combination of functional and immunological analyses. The presence of the 
      neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) was evaluated with respect to NCAM-specific 
      antigenic determinants attached to a polypeptide chain with appropriate 
      electrophoretic properties. By these criteria, NCAM-like molecules were detected in 
      all embryonic and adult vertebrates tested, and an adult mollusc, but not in an 
      adult insect, crustacean, or nematode. The functional assays measured adhesiveness 
      by simple aggregation of neural membrane vesicles, as well as by NCAM-specific 
      binding between membranes from different species. The presence of the NCAM antigen 
      in vertebrate membranes correlated with binding activity in both the NCAM-specific 
      and general adhesion assays, implying that the adhesiveness of these membranes 
      largely reflects NCAM-mediated binding. The results also indicate that NCAM function 
      has been conserved during the evolution of vertebrates, and supports the possibility 
      that mechanisms of nerve-nerve, nerve-muscle, and nerve-glial interaction, which 
      have been demonstrated previously to involve NCAM, may be similar for many 
      chordates. Whereas NCAM was not detected in adult fly and worm, these species did 
      express NCAM-like antigens transiently during early development. These results are 
      consistent with the hypothesis that NCAM is required during several periods of 
      development, and that the functions of this molecule in nematodes and insects may be 
      distinct from or a subset of those that occur in vertebrates. The expanded role of 
      the molecule represented by its expression during later stages of vertebrate 
      development may thus have been an important contribution to the evolution of 
      chordates.

TI  - Dihydropyridine and ryanodine binding in ventricles from rat, trout, dogfish and 
      hagfish.
PG  - 1999-2009
AB  - In the adult mammalian heart, the majority of Ca2+ required for contraction is 
      released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via the Ca2+-release channel or 
      ryanodine receptor (RyR). Such release is dependent upon a relatively small influx 
      of Ca2+ entering the cell across the sarcolemma (SL) by means of the L-type Ca2+ 
      channel or the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR). In lower vertebrates, there is 
      indirect evidence suggesting that Ca2+ influx across the SL may be sufficient to 
      support contraction in the absence of Ca2+ release from the SR. This apparent 
      difference in myocardial excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling was investigated 
      further by determining DHPR and RyR densities in ventricular homogenate preparations 
      from rat, trout, dogfish and hagfish. DHPR Bmax values (means +/- S.E.M.) were 
      highest in rat (0.30 +/- 0.01 pmol mg-1), lower in trout (0.16 +/- 0.01 pmol mg-1) 
      and dogfish (0.27 +/- 0.03 pmol mg-1), and slightly above the level of detection in 
      hagfish (0.03 +/- 0.01 pmol mg-1). The DHPR dissociation constants (Kd) of 40-70 
      pmoll-1 in these three species were of similar magnitude. RyR binding revealed both 
      high- and low-affinity sites in all species. RyR Bmax for the high-affinity site was 
      greatest in the rat (0.68 pmol mg-1), lower in trout (0.19 pmol mg-1) and dogfish 
      (0.07 pmol mg-1) and lowest in hagfish (0.01 pmol mg-1). The RyR Kd1 values for the 
      high-affinity sites were comparable in all preparations (range 12-87 nmoll-1). The 
      quantitative expression of RyRs in these species is consistent with the relative 
      amount of SR present as indicated in physiological experiments and electron 
      micrographs. Taking into consideration myocyte morphology of teleost and 
      elasmobranch species, the data are consistent with a greater reliance on Ca2+ influx 
      across the SL during E-C coupling in lower vertebrates, although a functional role 
      for Ca2+ release from the SR in the more active species await further investigation.

TI  - Hepatomas and other neoplasms in the atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa): a 
      histopathologic and chemical study.
PG  - 342-55
AB  - M. glutinosa is a cyclostome, living in the mud in seawater of high salinity. It 
      probably is a stationary scavenger feeder. About 28,000 hagfish from the Gullmar 
      Fjord were examined during a 5-year period for the occurrence of tumors. Hepatomas 
      were found to be predominant neoplasm, observed at a frequency that decreased from 
      5.8% in 1972 to 2.9% in 1973 and finally to 0.6% in 1974--76. Islet cell hamartomas 
      and frank neoplasms decreased from 0.5% in 1972 to less than 0.1% in 1973--76. 
      Occasional subcutaneous and mesenterial neoplasms were also observed during 
      1972--74. In hagfish caught 12 km out in the open sea, the hepatoma incidence 
      decreased from 2.8% in 1972 to 0.9% in 1974. Given this background, it is possible 
      that pollution of the Gullmar Fjord by carcinogenic substances with low 
      biodegradability has occurred until 1972, and this pollution could be of etiologic 
      significance for these hagfish tumors. In fact, the use of PCBs became prohibited by 
      law in Sweden in 1971--72. Severe restrictions were also introduced for the use of 
      chlorinated pesticides, notably DDT, and associated substances (DDD, DDE). 
      Preliminary analyses for the presence of PCBs, DDT (and its metabolites), and 
      aflatoxins (the notorious hepatocarcinogen) were performed by gas chromatography and 
      thin-layer chromatography. Livers (with and without neoplasms) from hagfish caught 
      inside the threshold of the fjord contained about 5 mg/kg of wet weight of PCBs and 
      about 0.1--0.4 mg/kg of dry weight of DDT, DDD, or DDE, whereas those from hagfish 
      caught in the open sea had a much lower PCB concentration (about 0.2 mg/kg of wet 
      weight). No PCBs and no chlorinated pesticides were found in analyses of the mud at 
      the catching site. High PCB concentrations (3 mg/kg of wet weight) were, however, 
      observed in livers from cod living in the Gullmar Fjord, and it was proposed that 
      bony fish may be the source of hagfish liver PCBs. PCB chromatograms of hagfish 
      livers differed from those of PCB standards and cod liver. This strange pattern, 
      which was not seen in livers from hagfish caught in the open sea, might be explained 
      by an unusual mode of metabolization. The assays for aflatoxins gave completely 
      negative results.

TI  - Vitronectin diversity in evolution but uniformity in ligand binding and size of the 
      core polypeptide.
PG  - 1-10
AB  - We isolated vitronectins from the plasma or sera of 14 animal species including 
      mouse and rat by heparin affinity chromatography. They cross-reacted with 
      anti-vitronectin antibody and their amino terminal sequences showed strong homology. 
      They also promoted spreading of BHK cells and were bound to heparin and collagen in 
      the same way. Therefore, these properties appear to be essential for vitronectin 
      function. However, the apparent molecular weights of these vitronectins varied 
      considerable from 59 to 78 kDa in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel 
      electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). In addition, the number of bands also varied from 1 to 
      3. To search for the uniformity of vitronectin polypeptide, vitronectins were 
      deglycosylated and examined by Ferguson plot analysis. The size of the polypeptide 
      portion of vitronectins was estimated to range from 40 to 57 kDa which was 19-26 kDa 
      smaller than original values. Supposing a possible cleavage site at 5-13 kDa far 
      from the carboxyl terminus, all vitronectin polypeptides were speculated to be 
      synthesized de novo in the size range of 50-57 kDa. Proteins reacting with 
      anti-vitronectin antibody were also detected on the immunoblot of 13 more species 
      including Drosophila and Physarum. Almost all of these vitronectin-like proteins 
      showed marked species-specific variations in their apparent molecular weights from 
      51 to 96 kDa in SDS-PAGE.

TI  - Cathelicidin family of antimicrobial peptides: proteolytic processing and protease 
      resistance.
PG  - 425-36
AB  - Cathelicidins are a gene family of antimicrobial peptides produced as inactive 
      precursors. Signal peptidase removes the N-terminal signal sequence, while 
      peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase often amidates and cleaves the 
      C-terminal region. Removal of the cathelin domain liberates the active antimicrobial 
      peptide. For mammalian sequences, this cleavage usually occurs through the action of 
      elastase, but other tissue-specific processing enzymes may also operate. Once 
      released, these bioactive peptides are susceptible to proteolytic degradation. We 
      propose that some mature cathelicidins are naturally resistant to proteases due to 
      their unusual primary structures. Among mammalian cathelicidins, proline-rich 
      sequences should resist attack by serine proteases because proline prevents cleavage 
      of the scissile bond. In hagfish cathelicidins, the unusual amino acid 
      bromotryptophan may make the active peptides less susceptible to proteolysis for 
      steric reasons. Such protease resistance could extend the pharmacokinetic lifetimes 
      of cathelicidins in vivo, sustaining antimicrobial activity.

TI  - Multiple opioid receptor-like genes are identified in diverse vertebrate phyla.
PG  - 25-9
AB  - Polymerase chain reaction was used to determine whether opioid receptor-like 
      sequences are present in species from the protostome and deuterostome branches of 
      the metazoan kingdom. Multiple opioid receptor-like sequences were found in all 
      vertebrates, but no specific fragments were obtained from any invertebrates. Delta, 
      mu, kappa and ORL-1 receptors were identified from bovine DNA, and three different 
      opioid receptor-like fragments were identified from the other vertebrates analyzed. 
      The data suggest that the opioid receptor gene family has been highly conserved 
      during vertebrate evolution and that, even in the primitive jawless fish, multiple 
      members of the opioid receptor family appear to be present.

TI  - Hormone studies in Myxine glutinosa: effects of the eicosanoids arachidonic acid, 
      prostaglandin E1, E2, A2, F2 alpha, thromboxane B2 and of indomethacin on plasma 
      cortisol, blood pressure, urine flow and electrolyte balance.
PG  - 621-6
AB  - Hagfish, Myxine glutinosa, were used in an investigation of the possible effects of 
      various eicosanoids and the prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor indomethacin, on 
      cortisol production, blood pressure control, urine flow and electrolyte balance. 
      Cortisol levels in plasma of untreated control animals and plasma from animals 1 h 
      following injection of 50 micrograms kg-1 prostaglandin E1, E2, A2, F2 alpha TXB2 
      and indomethacin were not detectable. However, plasma cortisol levels rose to 
      between 10 and 26 pg ml-1 1 h following injection of either 50 micrograms kg-1 
      arachidonic acid or prostaglandin E2. This rise was similar in magnitude to that 
      produced 1 h following administration of 50 micrograms kg-1 porcine ACTH. The 
      resting dorsal aortic blood pressure of between 3.50 and 3.75 mmHg was reduced on 
      average by 50% for 12-15 min when animals received 10 micrograms kg-1 arachidonic 
      acid, prostaglandin E1, E2, A2, and TXB2 and was effectively reduced to zero for 20 
      min or more following 50 micrograms kg-1 of these eicosanoids. Similar doses of 
      prostaglandin F2 alpha, however, evoked an increase in blood pressure (19-33%) 
      whilst indomethacin was without effect. Control measurements of urine flow in Myxine 
      were estimated to be between 540 and 660 microliters h-1 kg-1. There was a marked 
      reduction in urine output following the arterial vasodepression induced by 
      arachidonic acid, prostaglandin E1, E2, A2 and TXB2 in doses of 10 micrograms kg-1, 
      an effect which became even more pronounced following injection of 50 micrograms 
      kg-1 quantities, leading in some cases to complete anuria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

TI  - Evolution of angiotensin II-induced catecholamine release.
PG  - R65-9
AB  - The interaction between angiotensin II (ANG II) and catecholamines was examined in 
      nonmammalian vertebrates. ANG II challenge caused a significant pressor response in 
      representatives of the seven vertebrate classes. Additionally, plasma levels of both 
      epinephrine and norepinephrine increased following intravascular ANG II injection in 
      the conscious lumpfish, bullfrog, and turtle, and the anesthetized chicken. 
      Phentolamine pretreatment totally abolished ANG II pressor action in the hagfish and 
      chicken and diminished the ANG II pressor response in other classes of vertebrates. 
      The ability of ANG II to release catecholamines appears to be a phylogenetically 
      ancient interaction and indicates that catecholamines may play an important role in 
      the physiological expression of ANG II action in lower vertebrates.

TI  - Adriamycin affects glomerular renal function: evidence for the involvement of oxygen 
      radicals.
PG  - 195-203
AB  - The early nephrotoxic effect of the antitumor drug adriamycin (ADR) is suggested to 
      be related to the generation of oxygen free radicals. Therefore the O2-dependence 
      and the influence of free radical scavengers were studied in the model of the 
      isolated perfused single glomerulus of Myxine glutinosa and by histochemical 
      demonstration of the glomerular ATP-ase. In Myxine, the glomerular ATP-ase activity 
      was decreased after injection of ADR (5 mg/kg, i.v.). Both ADR-treated Myxine and 
      controls were exposed for 48 h to an artificial atmosphere of 20% O2/80% N2 or 80% 
      O2/20% N2, respectively. After 10 days a significant decrease of the hydraulic 
      conductivity (k) was measured in the experimental group exposed to 80% O2 (k-values 
      expressed as nl/s.mm Hg.mm2: controls (7): 0.059 +/- 0.017; ADR (7): 0.033 +/- 
      0.026). The reduction of k following the administration of ADR (20 mg/kg) could be 
      prevented by the sulphydryl donor N-acetylcysteine (NAC). The sieving coefficient 
      for albumin (phi) was significantly increased in ADR-treated animals, showing no 
      O2-dependence (phi x 10(-2): controls (7) 1.3 +/- 0.2; ADR 20% O2 (8): 8.1 +/- 9.6; 
      ADR 80% O2 (7): 6.9 +/- 6.7). phi was not affected by NAC. The lipid peroxide levels 
      in liver, kidney and heart of Myxine increased after the administration of ADR, 
      peaking by day 2 to 5. The circulation disorders of ADR-treated Myxine were not due 
      to an accumulation of the drug in the heart, but rather to a lack of the 
      intracellular antioxidant glutathione. It is concluded that the early nephrotoxic 
      effect of ADR, as reflected by a decreased glomerular ATP-ase activity, is mediated 
      by free radical formation. Oxidative stress on membrane compounds seems to reduce 
      the water permeability of the glomerular barrier, while the ADR-induced sieving 
      defect may be due to oxygen independent pathological mechanisms.

TI  - The conformation of insulin-like growth factors: relationships with insulins.
PG  - 53-64
AB  - The insulin-like growth factors and hystricomorph insulins have been modelled by 
      interactive computer graphics on the assumption that their sequence homology to 
      insulin implies that they will have a similar tertiary structure. These studies 
      suggest that, although the insulin-related molecules can adopt the insulin fold, 
      they are unlikely to form hexamers and if they form dimers they will be of reduced 
      stability. The non-suppressibility of insulin-like growth factors by anti-insulin 
      antibodies is explained in terms of differences of surface residues in the region 
      A8-A10 and B1-B5. Receptor affinity of insulins and insulin-like growth factors for 
      insulin receptors is explicable in terms of a receptor-binding site in the vicinity 
      of B25 Phe on the insulin surface. An equivalent region around B25 Tyr of 
      insulin-like growth factors may be responsible for their binding to type 1 
      receptors, although binding type 2 receptors must involve a different surface region 
      not shared by insulin.

TI  - Canonical VH CDR1 nucleotide sequences are conserved in all jawed vertebrates.
PG  - 847-54
AB  - The antibody combining site is formed from the complementarity-determining regions 
      (CDR) of the heavy and light chains. Function, in antibodies, means diverse 
      structures capable of binding a variety of ligands and the CDR have long been 
      distinguished as the sites of a high incidence os non-homologous replacement. The 
      present studies show, despite the apparent protein diversity, the existence of 
      canonical nucleotide sequences in the heavy chain CDR1. These sequences were deduced 
      from human and mouse CDR1, and their presence demonstrated experimentally in all 
      representatives from the gnathostome vertebrate classes. This unexpected 
      conservation suggests that selection pressure for sequence diversity is 
      counter-balanced by properties of the encoded amino acids such as capacity for 
      ligand interaction, structural requirements of the CDR loop and perhaps retention of 
      certain ligand-binding sequences. Part of the canonical nucleotide sequence involves 
      a motif that has been suggested as a hot spot for somatic hypermutation. The assay 
      for the canonical sequence is PCR-based and provides a novel approach to cloning 
      multigene family members by using the hypervariable portions as target sequence.

TI  - cDNA sequence coding for the alpha'-chain of the third complement component in the 
      African lungfish.
PG  - 367-75
AB  - cDNA clones coding for almost the entire C3 alpha-chain of the African lungfish 
      (Protopterus aethiopicus), a representative of the Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned 
      fishes), were sequenced and characterized. From the sequence it is deduced that the 
      lungfish C3 molecule is probably a disulphide-bonded alpha:beta dimer similar to 
      that of the C3 components of other jawed vertebrates. The deduced sequence contains 
      conserved sites presumably recognized by proteolytic enzymes (e.g. factor I) 
      involved in the activation and inactivation of the component. It also contains the 
      conserved thioester region and the putative site for binding properdin. However, the 
      site for the interaction with complement receptor 2 and factor H are poorly 
      conserved. Either complement receptor 2 and factor H are not present in the lungfish 
      or they bind to different residues at the same or a different site than mammalian 
      complement receptor 2 and factor H. The C3 alpha-chain sequences faithfully reflect 
      the phylogenetic relationships among vertebrate classes and can therefore be used to 
      help to resolve the long-standing controversy concerning the origin of the 
      tetrapods.

TI  - Immunological and biological evidence for a stanniocalcin-like hormone in human 
      kidney.
PG  - 1871-5
AB  - The corpuscles of Stannius are responsible for the synthesis and secretion of 
      stanniocalcin (STC), a glycoprotein hormone that regulates calcium and phosphate 
      homeostasis in fishes through its actions on the gills and kidneys. The corpuscles 
      of Stannius and STC are considered to be an endocrine system that is unique to 
      fishes. In this report, we provide evidence for the existence of STC-like proteins 
      in vertebrates other than fishes, in particular, humans. By using a 
      well-characterized RIA for salmon STC, sera from vertebrates as diverse as sharks 
      and humans contained measurable levels of STC-like immunoreactivity in the 
      concentration range commonly observed in fishes, and all of these sera exhibited 
      parallelism in the assay. By using Western blot analysis, proteins were also 
      identified in human kidney extracts that shared several properties with the fish 
      hormone in addition to their cross-reactivity with salmon STC antiserum. The same 
      antiserum was used to identify a discrete population of cells in human kidney 
      tubules that could be the source of serum immunoreactivity. Human kidney extracts 
      containing the STC-immunoreactive proteins also had STC-related effects when 
      injected into fishes. Collectively, the data suggest that STC may be more widespread 
      among the vertebrates than is currently accepted.

TI  - SCO-spondin is evolutionarily conserved in the central nervous system of the 
      chordate phylum.
PG  - 655-64
AB  - Bovine SCO-spondin was shown to be a brain-secreted glycoprotein specifically 
      expressed in the subcommissural organ, an ependymal differentiation located in the 
      roof of the Sylvian aqueduct. Also, SCO-spondin makes part of Reissner's fiber, a 
      phylogenetically and ontogenetically conserved structure present in the central 
      canal of the spinal cord of chordates. This secretion is a large multidomain protein 
      probably involved in axonal growth and/or guidance. As Reissner's fiber is highly 
      conserved in the chordate central nervous system, we sought genes orthologous to the 
      bovine SCO-spondin gene by Southern blot analysis in several members of the chordate 
      phylum: urochordates, cephalochordates, cyclostomes, and lower and higher 
      vertebrates, including humans. In addition, conserved glycoproteins present in the 
      subcommissural organ and Reissner's fiber were revealed by immunohistochemistry 
      using antibodies raised against bovine Reissner's fiber. Variation in the sites of 
      Reissner's fiber production according to chordate subphylum, presence of this 
      structure in the spinal cord, and conservation of the SCO-spondin gene are discussed 
      in the context of chordate central nervous system development. These results 
      indicate that SCO-spondin is an ancient ependymal secretion, making part of 
      Reissner's fiber, that may have had an important function during the evolution of 
      the central nervous system in chordates, including that of the spinal cord.

TI  - Evolution of skeletal type e-c coupling: a novel means of controlling calcium 
      delivery.
PG  - 695-704
AB  - The functional separation between skeletal and cardiac muscles, which occurs at the 
      threshold between vertebrates and invertebrates, involves the evolution of separate 
      contractile and control proteins for the two types of striated muscles, as well as 
      separate mechanisms of contractile activation. The functional link between 
      electrical excitation of the surface membrane and activation of the contractile 
      material (known as excitation-contraction [e-c] coupling) requires the interaction 
      between a voltage sensor in the surface membrane, the dihydropyridine receptor 
      (DHPR), and a calcium release channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the ryanodine 
      receptor (RyR). Skeletal and cardiac muscles have different isoforms of the two 
      proteins and present two structurally and functionally distinct modes of 
      interaction. We use structural clues to trace the evolution of the dichotomy from a 
      single, generic type of e-c coupling to a diversified system involving a novel 
      mechanism for skeletal muscle activation. Our results show that a significant 
      structural transition marks the protochordate to the Craniate evolutionary step, 
      with the appearance of skeletal muscle-specific RyR and DHPR isoforms.

AB  - In mammals, the heat shock protein gp96 complexed to antigenic peptides elicits T 
      cell adaptive immunity. By itself, however, gp96 can evoke responses that are 
      characteristic of innate immunity. Interestingly, this protein, which resides in the 
      endoplasmic reticulum, is expressed on the surface of certain mouse tumor cells. 
      Given that heat shock proteins are highly conserved, we investigated whether the 
      cell surface expression of gp96 is also evolutionarily conserved. Our data reveal 
      that gp96, most likely containing the endoplasmic reticulum retention motif (KDEL), 
      is expressed on the surface of three different Xenopus lymphoid tumor cell lines, 
      each derived from a different spontaneously arising thymic tumor. Levels of 
      expression differ among the tumor lines tested, with more immunogenic tumors 
      expressing greater amounts of surface gp96. Moreover, a high level of gp96 surface 
      expression is detectable on a subset of Xenopus normal nontransformed splenic 
      lymphocytes (mainly surface IgM+ B cells) but not on other normal cells, including 
      macrophages and nucleated erythrocytes. Surface expression of a gp96 protein 
      homologue occurs also on some, but not all, T and B cell clones derived from 
      peripheral blood cells of the channel catfish, as well as on lymphocyte-like cells, 
      but not on erythrocytes from the hagfish, a primitive agnathan vertebrate lacking 
      markers of an adaptive immune system. gp96 is actively directed to and retained on 
      the plasma membrane of Xenopus lymphocytes and tumor cells and hagfish 
      lymphocyte-like cells by a process that requires vesicular transport. This selective 
      surface expression of gp96 on some immune cells from different vertebrate classes is 
      consistent with an ancestral immunological role of gp96 as danger-signaling 
      molecule.

TI  - Functional characterization of two melanocortin (MC) receptors in lamprey showing 
      orthology to the MC1 and MC4 receptor subtypes.
PG  - 101
AB  - BACKGROUND: The melanocortin (MC) receptors have a key role in regulating body 
      weight and pigmentation. They belong to the rhodopsin family of G protein-coupled 
      receptors (GPCRs). The purpose of this study was to identify ancestral MC receptors 
      in agnathan, river lamprey. RESULTS: We report cloning of two MC receptors from 
      river lamprey. The lamprey receptors, designated MCa and MCb, showed orthology to 
      the MC1 and MC4 receptor subtypes, respectively. The molecular clock analysis 
      suggested that lamprey MC receptor genes were not duplicated recently and diverged 
      from each other more than 400 MYR ago. Expression and pharmacological 
      characterization showed that the lamprey MCa receptor was able to bind and be 
      activated by both lamprey and human MSH peptides. The lamprey MCa receptor had 
      relatively high affinity for ACTH derived peptides similarly to the fish MC 
      receptors. We found that both of the lamprey MC receptors were expressed in skin, 
      while the MCb receptor was also found in liver, heart and skeletal muscle. 
      CONCLUSION: This study shows presence of MC receptors in agnathans indicating early 
      signs of specific functions of melanocortin receptor subtypes.

TI  - Crystal structure of the TLR4-MD-2 complex with bound endotoxin antagonist Eritoran.
PG  - 906-17
AB  - TLR4 and MD-2 form a heterodimer that recognizes LPS (lipopolysaccharide) from 
      Gram-negative bacteria. Eritoran is an analog of LPS that antagonizes its activity 
      by binding to the TLR4-MD-2 complex. We determined the structure of the full-length 
      ectodomain of the mouse TLR4 and MD-2 complex. We also produced a series of hybrids 
      of human TLR4 and hagfish VLR and determined their structures with and without bound 
      MD-2 and Eritoran. TLR4 is an atypical member of the LRR family and is composed of 
      N-terminal, central, and C-terminal domains. The beta sheet of the central domain 
      shows unusually small radii and large twist angles. MD-2 binds to the concave 
      surface of the N-terminal and central domains. The interaction with Eritoran is 
      mediated by a hydrophobic internal pocket in MD-2. Based on structural analysis and 
      mutagenesis experiments on MD-2 and TLR4, we propose a model of TLR4-MD-2 
      dimerization induced by LPS.

TI  - Evolution of hormone-receptor complexity by molecular exploitation.
PG  - 97-101
AB  - According to Darwinian theory, complexity evolves by a stepwise process of 
      elaboration and optimization under natural selection. Biological systems composed of 
      tightly integrated parts seem to challenge this view, because it is not obvious how 
      any element's function can be selected for unless the partners with which it 
      interacts are already present. Here we demonstrate how an integrated molecular 
      system-the specific functional interaction between the steroid hormone aldosterone 
      and its partner the mineralocorticoid receptor-evolved by a stepwise Darwinian 
      process. Using ancestral gene resurrection, we show that, long before the hormone 
      evolved, the receptor's affinity for aldosterone was present as a structural 
      by-product of its partnership with chemically similar, more ancient ligands. 
      Introducing two amino acid changes into the ancestral sequence recapitulates the 
      evolution of present-day receptor specificity. Our results indicate that tight 
      interactions can evolve by molecular exploitation-recruitment of an older molecule, 
      previously constrained for a different role, into a new functional complex.

TI  - Characterization of insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin from the river lamprey, 
      Lampetra fluviatilis.
PG  - 96-105
AB  - Insulin has been isolated from an extract of the pancreas of an Agnathan, the river 
      lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis. The primary structure of the peptide (A-chain: GIVEQ 
      CCHRK CSIYD MENYC N; B-chain: SALTG AGGTH LCGSH LVEAL YVVCG DRGFF YTPSK T) is the 
      same as that of insulin from the sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus. In contrast, 
      Lampetra glucagon (HAQGS FTSDY SKYLD SKQAK DFVIW LMNT), isolated from an extract of 
      intestine, is structurally more similar to human glucagon (five amino acid 
      substitutions) than to Petromyzon glucagon (six substitutions). Similarly, the 
      primary structure of somatostatin (AAAAP GAAGG AQLPL GNRER KAGCK NFFWK TFSSC), 
      isolated from Lampetra pancreas, contains eight amino acid substitutions and an 
      additional residue compared with Petromyzon somatostatin. Somatostatin, isolated 
      from Lampetra brain, has an identical structure to mammalian somatostatin-14 (AGCKN 
      FFWKT FTSC), indicative of the same tissue-specific expression of different 
      somatostatin genes that was previously observed in Petromyzon. In contrast to the 
      reduced binding affinity of other fish insulins, lamprey insulin was equipotent with 
      porcine insulin in inhibiting the binding of [3-[125I]iodotyrosine-A14] human 
      insulin to the human insulin receptor.

TI  - Isolation of low molecular mass polypeptide complementary DNA clones from primitive 
      vertebrates. Implications for the origin of MHC class I-restricted antigen 
      presentation.
PG  - 4245-53
AB  - Proteasomes are the multisubunit proteases thought to be involved in the generation 
      of peptides presented by MHC class I molecules. When cells are stimulated with 
      IFN-gamma, two MHC encoded subunits, LMP2 and LMP7, are incorporated into the 
      proteasomal complex, presumably by displacing the housekeeping subunits, designated 
      Y and X, respectively. These changes in the subunit composition appear to facilitate 
      class I-mediated Ag presentation, presumably bu altering the cleavage specificities 
      of the proteasome. Here we show that the cartilaginous fish, the most primitive 
      class of vertebrates in which the MHC has been identified, have both LMP7 and X 
      genes. Interestingly, nurse sharks, a member of the cartilaginous fish, appear to 
      have two LMP7 genes, one encoding a typical LMP7 subunit and the other encoding a 
      less typical one. In contrast, only cDNA clones with residues characteristic of X 
      were identified in hagfishes and lampreys, the two extant members of the jawless 
      fish in which no MHC has been identified. Pairwise amino acid sequence comparison 
      and phylogenetic tree analysis showed that the subunits encoded by these clones were 
      nearly equidistant from LMP7 and X, suggesting that the LMP7 gene might have emerged 
      after the appearance of the jawless fish. Sequence comparison of the LMP7 and 
      X/X-like subunits isolated from various vertebrate species showed that, unlike the 
      X/X-like subunit, the LMP7 subunit displays a striking interspecies sequence 
      variability in the vicinity of its catalytic site.

TI  - Ancient divergence of insulin and insulin-like growth factor.
PG  - 939-49
AB  - Studies on the evolutionary pathway of the insulin gene family suggest that insulin 
      and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) became distinct molecules only after the 
      vertebrates arose. A single molecule with identity to both insulin and IGF was 
      reported in amphioxus. To study the origin of insulin, we selected tunicates because 
      their ancestors are thought to be a nodal point in the evolution of vertebrates. 
      This is the first report of separate insulin and IGF molecules from invertebrates. 
      Two cDNAs were isolated from the tunicate Chelyosoma productum: One cDNA encodes a 
      distinct preproinsulin with B, C, and A domains, whereas the other encodes tunicate 
      preproIGF, including all five domains in their proper sequence. Both mRNAs are 
      expressed in the nervous system, digestive tract, heart, and possibly the gonad but 
      not in branchial basket or tunic. Hence, insulin and igf genes have similar 
      expression patterns. In situ methods confirm the polymerase chain reaction evidence 
      that tunicate insulin and igf mRNAs are expressed in cortical cells of the neural 
      ganglion. We conclude that insulin and IGF have maintained separate gene lineages in 
      both vertebrate and protochordate evolution and, thus, a distinct evolutionary 
      history of more than 600 million years.

TI  - Recognition of lipopeptide patterns by Toll-like receptor 2-Toll-like receptor 6 
      heterodimer.
PG  - 873-84
LID - 10.1016/j.immuni.2009.09.018 [doi]
AB  - Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) initiates potent immune responses by recognizing 
      diacylated and triacylated lipopeptides. Its ligand specificity is controlled by 
      whether it heterodimerizes with TLR1 or TLR6. We have determined the crystal 
      structures of TLR2-TLR6-diacylated lipopeptide, TLR2-lipoteichoic acid, and 
      TLR2-PE-DTPA complexes. PE-DTPA, 
      1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic 
      acid, is a synthetic phospholipid derivative. Two major factors contribute to the 
      ligand specificity of TLR2-TLR1 or TLR2-TLR6 heterodimers. First, the lipid channel 
      of TLR6 is blocked by two phenylalanines. Simultaneous mutation of these 
      phenylalanines made TLR2-TLR6 fully responsive not only to diacylated but also to 
      triacylated lipopeptides. Second, the hydrophobic dimerization interface of 
      TLR2-TLR6 is increased by 80%, which compensates for the lack of amide lipid 
      interaction between the lipopeptide and TLR2-TLR6. The structures of the 
      TLR2-lipoteichoic acid and the TLR2-PE-DTPA complexes demonstrate that a precise 
      interaction pattern of the head group is essential for a robust immune response by 
      TLR2 heterodimers.

PG  - 701-3
AB  - A fossil hagfish (Myxinoidea), a new genus from the Pennsylvanian, shows tentacles, 
      structures of the head skeleton and internal organs. No other fossils of this group 
      have been reported. Although this new hagfish differs from living forms in position 
      of the gills, feeding apparatus, and relatively well developed eyes, it is quite 
      similar to its recent relatives. Thus, hagfishes have a long, conservative 
      geological history. Cladograms showing myxinoids as a sister group to the 
      vertebrates are supported.

TI  - EVIDENCE OF REGULATORY MECHANISMS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF BLOOD BETWEEN THE ARTERIAL 
      AND THE VENOUS COMPARTMENTS IN THE HAGFISH GILL POUCH.
PG  - 281-6
AB  - Of the extant vertebrate animals, the hagfishes are generally considered to be the 
      group which diverged first from the ancestral vertebrate lineage, although molecular 
      sequence analysis has recently suggested that they form a monophyletic group with 
      lampreys (Stock and Whitt, 1992). The circulatory system of hagfishes has features 
      that have been described as 'primitive' (Burggren et al. 1985), but their gills are 
      effective gas exchangers. The gills are contained within discrete muscular pouches, 
      and the anatomy of the blood system and ventilatory ducts has an ideal 
      countercurrent arrangement (Mallatt and Paulsen, 1986; Elger, 1987). Reite (1969) 
      first reported effects of catecholamines and other drugs on the branchial 
      vasculature of hagfish. Recent studies of both perfused gills in situ and of blood 
      flow in vivo have suggested that blood flow through the gills of hagfish is under 
      tonic control by catecholamines (Axelsson et al. 1990; Forster et al. 1992). In 
      teleosts, several studies have shown that adrenergic control mechanisms are involved 
      in the distribution of blood between the arterio-arterial and the arterio-venous 
      pathways of the gill vasculature (see Nilsson, 1983). Anatomical and ultrastructural 
      studies have demonstrated the existence of similar pathways in hagfish (Cole, 1925; 
      Mallatt and Paulsen, 1986; Elger, 1987). The experiments reported here demonstrate 
      that, in the hagfish gill pouch, both adrenaline and isoprenaline can increase the 
      proportion of fluid leaving via the efferent arterial route, at the expense of the 
      venous outflow. Hagfish (Eptatretus cirrhatus Forster) were collected off Motunau, 
      North Canterbury, New Zealand, and held in seawater aquaria until used. The masses 
      of the 11 animals used in these experiments ranged from 680 to 1720 g with a mean of 
      1140&plusmn;110 g (s.e.m.). Animals were anaesthetized in a 0.4 % solution of 
      benzocaine in sea water. The hagfish were opened ventrally to expose the gills and 
      their blood supply. Individual gill pouches were prepared for perfusion studies.

AB  - The size of animal cells rarely scales with body size, likely due to biophysical and 
      physiological constraints.(1)(,)(2) In hagfishes, gland thread cells (GTCs) each 
      produce a silk-like proteinaceous fiber called a slime thread.(3)(,)(4) The slime 
      threads impart strength to a hagfish's defensive slime and thus are potentially 
      subject to selection on their function outside of the body.(5-8) Body size is of 
      fundamental importance in predator-prey interactions, which led us to hypothesize 
      that larger hagfishes produce longer and stronger slime threads than smaller 
      ones.(9) Here, by sampling a range of sizes of hagfish from 19 species, we 
      systematically examined the scaling of GTC and slime-thread dimensions with body 
      size within both phylogenetic and ontogenetic contexts. We found that the length of 
      GTCs varied between 40 and 250 μm and scaled positively with body size, exhibiting 
      an allometric exponent greater than those in other animal cells. Correspondingly, 
      larger hagfishes produce longer and thicker slime threads and thus are equipped to 
      defend against larger predators. With diameter and length varying 4-fold (0.7-4 μm 
      and 5-22 cm, respectively) over a body-size range of 10-128 cm, the slime threads 
      characterize the largest intracellular polymers known in biology. Our results 
      suggest selection for stronger defensive slime in larger hagfishes has driven the 
      evolution of extreme size and allometry of GTCs.

PG  - 200
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2013.00200 [doi]
LID - 200
AB  - The hypothalamic-pituitary system is considered to be a seminal event that emerged 
      prior to or during the differentiation of the ancestral agnathans (jawless 
      vertebrates). Hagfishes as one of the only two extant members of the class of 
      agnathans are considered the most primitive vertebrates known, living or extinct. 
      Accordingly, studies on their reproduction are important for understanding the 
      evolution and phylogenetic aspects of the vertebrate reproductive endocrine system. 
      In gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates), the hormones of the hypothalamus and pituitary 
      have been extensively studied and shown to have well-defined roles in the control of 
      reproduction. In hagfish, it was thought that they did not have the same 
      neuroendocrine control of reproduction as gnathostomes, since it was not clear 
      whether the hagfish pituitary gland contained tropic hormones of any kind. This 
      review highlights the recent findings of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal 
      endocrine system in the hagfish. In contrast to gnathostomes that have two 
      gonadotropins (GTH: luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone), only one 
      pituitary GTH has been identified in the hagfish. Immunohistochemical and functional 
      studies confirmed that this hagfish GTH was significantly correlated with the 
      developmental stages of the gonads and showed the presence of a steroid (estradiol) 
      feedback system at the hypothalamic-pituitary levels. Moreover, while the identity 
      of hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) has not been determined, 
      immunoreactive (ir) GnRH has been shown in the hagfish brain including seasonal 
      changes of ir-GnRH corresponding to gonadal reproductive stages. In addition, a 
      hagfish PQRFamide peptide was identified and shown to stimulate the expression of 
      hagfish GTHβ mRNA in the hagfish pituitary. These findings provide evidence that 
      there are neuroendocrine-pituitary hormones that share common structure and 
      functional features compared to later evolved vertebrates.

TI  - Cyclostome embryology and early evolutionary history of vertebrates.

AB  - Modern agnathans include only two groups, the lampreys and the hagfish, that 
      collectively comprise the group Cyclostomata. Although accumulating molecular data 
      support the cyclostomes as a monophyletic group, there remain some unsettled 
      questions regarding the evolutionary relationships of these animals in that they 
      differ greatly in anatomical and developmental patterns and in their life histories. 
      In this review, we summarize recent developmental data on the lamprey and discuss 
      some questions related to vertebrate evolutionary development raised by the limited 
      information available on hagfish embryos. Comparison of the lamprey and gnathostome 
      developmental patterns suggests some plesiomorphic traits of vertebrates that would 
      have already been established in the most recent common ancestor of the vertebrates. 
      Understanding hagfish development will further clarify the, as yet, unrecognized 
      ancestral characters that either the lampreys or hagfishes may have lost. We stress 
      the immediate importance of hagfish embryology in the determination of the most 
      plausible scenario for the early history of vertebrate evolution, by addressing 
      questions about the origins of the neural crest, thyroid, and adenohypophysis as 
      examples.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The vertebrate body is characterized by its dual segmental 
      organization: pharyngeal arches in the head and somites in the trunk. Muscular and 
      nervous system morphologies are also organized following these metameric patterns, 
      with distinct differences between head and trunk; branchiomeric nerves innervating 
      pharyngeal arches are superficial to spinal nerves innervating somite derivatives. 
      Hypobranchial muscles originate from rostral somites and occupy the "neck" at the 
      head-trunk interface. Hypobranchial muscles, unlike ventral trunk muscles in the 
      lateral body wall, develop from myocytes that migrate ventrally to occupy a space 
      that is ventrolateral to the pharynx and unassociated with coelomic cavities. 
      Occipitospinal nerves innervating these muscles also extend ventrally, thereby 
      crossing the vagus nerve laterally. RESULTS: In hagfishes, the basic morphological 
      pattern of vertebrates is obliterated by the extreme caudal shift of the posterior 
      part of the pharynx. The vagus nerve is found unusually medially, and occipitospinal 
      nerves remain unfasciculated, appearing as metameric spinal nerves as in the 
      posterior trunk region. Moreover, the hagfish exhibits an undifferentiated body 
      plan, with the hypobranchial muscles not well dissociated from the abaxial muscles 
      in the trunk. Comparative embryological observation showed that this 
      hagfish-specific morphology is established by secondary modification of the common 
      vertebrate embryonic pattern, and the hypobranchial muscle homologue can be found in 
      the rostral part of the oblique muscle with pars decussata. CONCLUSION: The 
      morphological pattern of the hagfish represents an extreme case of heterotopy that 
      led to the formation of the typical hypoglossal nerve, and can be regarded as an 
      autapomorphic trait of the hagfish lineage.

TI  - First fossil lamprey: a record from the Pennsylvanian of Illinois.
PG  - 1265-7
AB  - A fossil record of lampreys has previously been unknown. A new genus demonstrates 
      the presence of this group in the Pennsylvanian. The body outline, parts of the head 
      skeleton, rasping tongue mechanism, gill basket, and other internal organs are 
      preserved. The fossils are very similar in structure to modern forms. The absence of 
      hagfish characters in the fossil supports the view that the common ancestor of 
      lampreys and hagfishes lived prior to the Pennsylvanian.

TI  - A New Model of Hagfish Slime Mucous Vesicle Stabilization and Deployment.
PG  - 6681-6689
LID - 10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c00639 [doi]
AB  - Hagfishes thwart predators by releasing large volumes of gill-clogging slime, which 
      consists of mucus and silk-like fibers. The mucous fraction originates within gland 
      mucous cells, which release numerous vesicles that swell and rupture when ejected 
      into seawater. Several studies have examined the function of hagfish slime mucous 
      vesicles in vitro, but a comprehensive model of their biophysics is lacking. Here, 
      we tested the hypothesis that vesicles contain polyanionic glycoproteins stabilized 
      by divalent cations and deploy in seawater via exchange of divalent for monovalent 
      cations. We also tested the hypothesis that vesicle swelling and stabilization are 
      governed by "Hofmeister effects". We found no evidence for either hypothesis. Our 
      results show that hagfish mucous granules are only stabilized by multivalent anions, 
      and pH titration experiments underscore these results. Our results lead us to the 
      conclusion that the hagfish slime mucous gel is in fact polycationic in nature.

TI  - The sensory biology of the living jawless fishes: a phylogenetic assessment.
PG  - 262-76
AB  - Despite the ancient origins and aberrant appearance of living jawless fishes, none 
      of their features may be assumed to be primitive without comparisons among 
      hagfishes, lampreys, and gnathostomes, and with the nearest relatives of all 
      craniates, the cephalochordates. In this review, the sensory capabilities of 
      lampreys and hagfishes will be compared, and the major features of early craniate 
      sensory evolution will be infered using cladistic methodology and an accepted 
      phylogeny of the hagfishes, lampreys and gnathostomes. Lampreys have well developed 
      olfactory, visual and octavolateralis systems, each of which is known to play a role 
      in lamprey life and behavior. Hagfishes have poorly developed visual and 
      octavolateralis systems, but elaborate olfactory and chemosensory systems. 
      Unfortunately, the natural behavior and lifestyle of hagfishes are poorly known, 
      limiting our understanding of hagfish sensory biology. Both groups of living jawless 
      fishes show mixtures of primitive and secondarily derived sensory features and have 
      few shared derived sensory features that would indicate close relations between the 
      two groups.

TI  - Forebrain Architecture and Development in Cyclostomes, with Reference to the Early 
      Morphology and Evolution of the Vertebrate Head.
PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.1159/000519026 [doi]
AB  - The vertebrate head and brain are characterized by highly complex morphological 
      patterns. The forebrain, the most anterior division of the brain, is subdivided into 
      the diencephalon, hypothalamus, and telencephalon from the neuromeric subdivision 
      into prosomeres. Importantly, the telencephalon contains the cerebral cortex, which 
      plays a key role in higher order cognitive functions in humans. To elucidate the 
      evolution of the forebrain regionalization, comparative analyses of the brain 
      development between extant jawed and jawless vertebrates are crucial. Cyclostomes - 
      lampreys and hagfishes - are the only extant jawless vertebrates, and diverged from 
      jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) over 500 million years ago. Previous developmental 
      studies on the cyclostome brain were conducted mainly in lampreys because hagfish 
      embryos were rarely available. Although still scarce, the recent availability of 
      hagfish embryos has propelled comparative studies of brain development and gene 
      expression. By integrating findings with those of cyclostomes and fossil jawless 
      vertebrates, we can depict the morphology, developmental mechanism, and even the 
      evolutionary path of the brain of the last common ancestor of vertebrates. In this 
      review, we summarize the development of the forebrain in cyclostomes and suggest 
      what evolutionary changes each cyclostome lineage underwent during brain evolution. 
      In addition, together with recent advances in the head morphology in fossil 
      vertebrates revealed by CT scanning technology, we discuss how the evolution of 
      craniofacial morphology and the changes of the developmental mechanism of the 
      forebrain towards crown gnathostomes are causally related.

TI  - The skin of fish as a transport epithelium: a review.
PG  - 877-91
LID - 10.1007/s00360-013-0761-4 [doi]
AB  - The primary function of fish skin is to act as a barrier. It provides protection 
      against physical damage and assists with the maintenance of homoeostasis by 
      minimising exchange between the animal and the environment. However in some fish, 
      the skin may play a more active physiological role. This is particularly true in 
      species that inhabit specialised environmental niches (e.g. amphibious and 
      air-breathing fish such as the lungfish), those with physiological characteristics 
      that may subvert the need for the integument as a barrier (e.g. the osmoconforming 
      hagfish), and/or fish with anatomical modifications of the epidermis (e.g. reduced 
      epithelial thickness). Using examples from different fish groups (e.g. hagfishes, 
      elasmobranchs and teleosts), the importance of fish skin as a transport epithelium 
      for gases, ions, nitrogenous waste products, and nutrients was reviewed. The role of 
      the skin in larval fish was also examined, with early life stages often utilising 
      the skin as a surrogate gill, prior to the development of a functional branchial 
      epithelium.

PG  - 986
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2020.00986 [doi]
LID - 986
AB  - Neural crest and placodes are key innovations of the vertebrate clade. These cells 
      arise within the dorsal ectoderm of all vertebrate embryos and have the 
      developmental potential to form many of the morphological novelties within the 
      vertebrate head. Each cell population has its own distinct developmental features 
      and generates unique cell types. However, it is essential that neural crest and 
      placodes associate together throughout embryonic development to coordinate the 
      emergence of several features in the head, including almost all of the cranial 
      peripheral sensory nervous system and organs of special sense. Despite the 
      significance of this developmental feat, its evolutionary origins have remained 
      unclear, owing largely to the fact that there has been little comparative 
      (evolutionary) work done on this topic between the jawed vertebrates and 
      cyclostomes-the jawless lampreys and hagfishes. In this review, we briefly summarize 
      the developmental mechanisms and genetics of neural crest and placodes in both jawed 
      and jawless vertebrates. We then discuss recent studies on the role of neural crest 
      and placodes-and their developmental association-in the head of lamprey embryos, and 
      how comparisons with jawed vertebrates can provide insights into the causes and 
      consequences of this event in early vertebrate evolution.

TI  - The complete nucleotide sequence of the mitochondrial DNA of the agnathan Lampetra 
      fluviatilis: bearings on the phylogeny of cyclostomes.
PG  - 519-29
AB  - There are two competing theories about the interrelationships of craniates: the 
      cyclostome theory assumes that lampreys and hagfishes are a clade, the cyclostomes, 
      whose sister group is the jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes); the vertebrate theory 
      assumes that lampreys and gnathostomes are a clade, the vertebrates, whose sister 
      group is hagfishes. The vertebrate theory is best supported by a number of unique 
      anatomical and physiological characters. Molecular sequence data from 18S and 28S 
      rRNA genes rather support the cyclostome theory, but mtDNA sequence of Myxine 
      glutinosa rather supports the vertebrate theory. Additional molecular data are thus 
      needed to elucidate this three-taxon problem. We determined the complete nucleotide 
      sequence of the mtDNA of the lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis. The mtDNA of L. 
      fluviatilis possesses the same genomic organization as Petromyzon marinus, which 
      validates this gene order as a synapomorphy of lampreys. The mtDNA sequence of L. 
      fluviatilis was used in combination with relevant mtDNA sequences for an approach to 
      the hagfish/lamprey relationships using the maximum-parsimony, neighbor-joining, and 
      maximum-likelihood methods. Although trees compatible with our present knowledge of 
      the phylogeny of craniates can be reconstructed by using the three methods, the data 
      collected do not support the vertebrate or the cyclostome hypothesis. The present 
      data set does not allow the resolution of this three-taxon problem, and new kinds of 
      data, such as nuclear DNA sequences, need to be collected.

TI  - Molecular strategies of tooth enamel formation are highly conserved during 
      vertebrate evolution.
PG  - 73-80; discussion 81-4
AB  - The vertebrate body plan is determined by a variety of morphoregulatory genes that 
      are highly conserved throughout evolution. This review presents a phylogenetic 
      analysis of selected molecular and morphological features in vertebrates with 
      particular emphasis upon the phylogeny of tooth morphogenesis and enamel formation. 
      Three lines of evidence support our hypothesis that the agnathans (e.g. hagfishes) 
      are the most primitive extant vertebrates and that enamel gene products are highly 
      conserved during vertebrate evolution. First, an antibody raised against the 
      polypeptide produced by exon 4 of the mouse amelogenin gene recognizes proteins in 
      hagfish, sharks, reptiles and mammals. Second, electron photomicrographic evidence 
      suggests heterochronic shifts in the relative time and rate of enamel formation 
      during vertebrate tooth evolution. Third, mRNA phenotyping suggests significant 
      homology between amelogenin transcripts expressed in species of various vertebrate 
      phyla including agnathans and mammals. These three lines of evidence indicate that 
      amelogenin gene products are expressed in agnathan, reptilian and mammalian teeth.

TI  - Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH) Gene Family Duplications in Lampreys Correlate 
      With Two Early Vertebrate Genome Doublings.

AB  - The ancestor of gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates) is generally considered to have 
      undergone two rounds of whole genome duplication (WGD). The timing of these WGD 
      events relative to the divergence of the closest relatives of the gnathostomes, the 
      cyclostomes, has remained contentious. Lampreys and hagfishes are extant cyclostomes 
      whose gene families can shed light on the relationship between the WGDs and the 
      cyclostome-gnathostome divergence. Previously, we have characterized in detail the 
      evolution of the gnathostome corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) family and found 
      that its five members arose from two ancestral genes that existed before the WGDs. 
      The two WGDs resulted, after secondary losses, in one triplet consisting of CRH1, 
      CRH2, and UCN1, and one pair consisting of UCN2 and UCN3. All five genes exist in 
      representatives for cartilaginous fishes, ray-finned fishes, and lobe-finned fishes. 
      Differential losses have occurred in some lineages. We present here analyses of 
      CRH-family members in lamprey and hagfish by comparing sequences and gene synteny 
      with gnathostomes. We found five CRH-family genes in each of two lamprey species 
      (Petromyzon marinus and Lethenteron camtschaticum) and two genes in a hagfish 
      (Eptatretus burgeri). Synteny analyses show that all five lamprey CRH-family genes 
      have similar chromosomal neighbors as the gnathostome genes. The most parsimonious 
      explanation is that the lamprey CRH-family genes are orthologs of the five 
      gnathostome genes and thus arose in the same chromosome duplications. This suggests 
      that lampreys and gnathostomes share the same two WGD events and that these took 
      place before the lamprey-gnathostome divergence.

TI  - The hagfish oocyte at late stages of oogenesis: structural and metabolic events at 
      the micropylar region.
PG  - 259-73
AB  - The hagfishes (Class Agnatha), primitive vertebrates and massive secretors of mucus, 
      occupy a unique niche in a marine benthic environment and exists in abundance 
      despite an infrequent ovulation of a low number (12-45) of notably large, prolate 
      ellipsoidal (approximately 8 mm x 28 mm, width x length, respectively) eggs. To 
      establish factors that might contribute to survivability of one species (Eptatretus 
      stouti), we examined three groups of mature females and document structural events 
      characteristic of oocytes at late developmental stages: attached to the gonad, after 
      ovulation into the body cavity, and after deposition on aquaria substrata. 
      Quantitative autoradiographic analyses following administration in vivo of 
      [(3)H]-leucine was useful to confirm post-vitellogenic stages and late metabolic 
      events at the micropylar region located at one end of each egg. After egg 
      disassembly, a combination of light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy was 
      used to delineate structural features and 3-D relationships in juxtaposition to the 
      micropylar cup and canal. A thick (approximately 200 microm) complex tripartite 
      chorion surrounds a large micropylar cup (approximately 300 microm, width at base) 
      consisting of fused polygonal (mainly hexagonal) substructural units (3-4 microm, 
      width) and collectively serves to stabilize the micropylar canal (of size to prevent 
      polyspermy) that penetrates the ooplasm near the germinal vesicle. A tuft composed 
      of numerous chorionic appendages ('anchor filaments', approximately 2-3 mm length) 
      is enmeshed in a gel matrix and surrounds the cup. When the eggs are deposited, 
      intermediate filament aggregates (IFA) from slime gland mucus become interspersed in 
      the tuft/gel complex. A similar IFA/tuft/gel region found on the vegetal pole-end 
      facilitates firm egg-end attachments and possibly assists localization of egg 
      clutches to a favorable substratum. Although the mode of fertilization is as yet 
      unknown, the collective structural characteristics of the hagfish egg arc indicative 
      of physical strength and are markedly different from eggs of the other group of 
      cyclostomes (lampreys) and from teleosts. The hagfish produces fewer but larger eggs 
      which are prolate ellipsoidal rather than spherical and have a thicker chorion, a 
      greater chorion to egg width ratio, a much larger micropylar cup with a unique 
      substructure, larger and more localized chorionic appendages, and appendage tufts 
      interspersed with adhesive substances derived not only from the follicular 
      epithelium but also from the slime glands.

TI  - From ultra-soft slime to hard {alpha}-keratins: The many lives of intermediate 
      filaments.
PG  - 32-9
LID - 10.1093/icb/icp007 [doi]
AB  - Intermediate filaments are filaments 10 nm in diameter that make up an important 
      component of the cytoskeleton in most metazoan taxa. They are most familiar for 
      their role as the fibrous component of α-keratins such as skin, hair, nail, and horn 
      but are also abundant within living cells. Although they are almost exclusively 
      intracellular in their distribution, in the case of the defensive slime produced by 
      hagfishes, they are secreted. This article surveys the impressive diversity of 
      biomaterials that animals construct from intermediate filaments and will focus on 
      the mechanisms by which the mechanical properties of these materials are achieved. 
      Hagfish slime is a dilute network of hydrated mucus and compliant intermediate 
      filament bundles with ultrasoft material properties. Within the cytoplasm of living 
      cells, networks of intermediate filaments form soft gels whose elasticity arises via 
      entropic mechanisms. Single intermediate filaments or bundles are also elastic, but 
      substantially stiffer, exhibiting modulus values similar to that of rubber. Hard 
      α-keratins like wool are stiffer still, an effect that is likely achieved via 
      dehydration of the intermediate filaments in these epidermal appendages. The diverse 
      mechanisms described here have been employed by animals to generate materials with 
      stiffness values that span an impressive eleven orders of magnitude.

TI  - The heart as a working model to explore themes and strategies for anoxic survival in 
      ectothermic vertebrates.
PG  - 300-12
AB  - Most vertebrates die within minutes when deprived of molecular oxygen (anoxia), in 
      part because of cardiac failure, which can be traced to an inadequate matching of 
      cardiac ATP supply to ATP demand. Cardiac power output (PO; estimated from the 
      product of cardiac output and central arterial pressure and an indirect measure of 
      cardiac ATP demand) is directly related to cardiac ATP supply up to some maximal 
      level during both normoxia (ATP supply estimated from myocardial O(2) consumption) 
      and anoxia (ATP supply estimated from lactate production rates). Thus, steady state 
      PO provides an excellent means to examine anoxia tolerance strategies among 
      ectothermic vertebrates by indicating a matching of cardiac glycolytic ATP supply 
      and demand. Here, we summarize in vitro measurements of PO data from rainbow trout, 
      freshwater turtles and hagfishes to provide a reasonable benchmark PO of 0.7 mW 
      g(-1) for maximum glycolytic potential of ectothermic hearts at 15 degrees C, which 
      corresponds to a glycolytic ATP turnover rate of about 70 nmol ATP g(-1) s(-1). 
      Using this benchmark to evaluate in vivo PO data for hagfishes, carps and turtles, 
      we identify two cardiac survival strategies, which in conjunction with creative 
      waste management techniques to reduce waste accumulation, allow for long-term 
      cardiac survival during anoxia in these anoxia-tolerant species. Hagfish and crucian 
      carp exemplify a strategy of evolving such a low routine PO that routine cardiac ATP 
      demand lies within the range of the maximum cardiac glycolytic potential. Common 
      carp and freshwater turtles exemplify an active strategy of temporarily and 
      substantially decreasing cardiac and whole body metabolism so that PO is below 
      maximum cardiac glycolytic potential during chronic anoxia despite being quite close 
      to this potential under normoxia.

TI  - [Progress of adaptive immunity system of agnathan vertebrates].
PG  - 969-76
AB  - Extant jawless vertebrates, represented by lampreys and hagfishes, have innate 
      immune receptors with variable domains structurally resembling T/B-cell receptors. 
      However, they lack cardinal elements of adaptive immunity shared by all jawed 
      vertebrates: T/B-cell receptors and major histocompatibility complex molecules. 
      Thus, it is widely believed that adaptive immunity is unique to jawed vertebrates. 
      Recently, this belief was overturned by the discovery of agnathan antigen receptors, 
      known as variable lymphocyte receptors. These receptors generate diversity in their 
      antigen-binding sites through assembling highly diverse leucine-rich repeat modules. 
      The crystal structures of hagfish variable lymphocyte receptor monomers indicate 
      that they adopt a horseshoe-shaped structure and likely bind antigens through the 
      hypervariable concave surface. Secreted variable lymphocyte receptors form pentamers 
      or tetramers of dimers bind antigens with high specificity and avidity. This 
      indicates that jawed and jawless vertebrates have developed antigen receptors 
      independently. This paper provides valuable clues for studying the origin and 
      evolution of adaptive immunity system.

TI  - Current knowledge of hagfish reproduction: implications for fisheries management.
PG  - 158-65
LID - 10.1093/icb/45.1.158 [doi]
AB  - This review briefly summarizes the latest findings on reproductive endocrinology of 
      Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) and implications for fisheries management. In 
      response to a major decline or collapse of the fisheries (groundfish and anadromous 
      species) industry in the Northeast, species that were once considered alternative or 
      underutilized have and are being identified that may be suitable for commercial 
      harvest, one such example is the hagfish. Hagfish in recent years have been sought 
      after as valuable fish not only for their flesh, but also their skin. Currently, 
      there are no regulations governing the harvesting of hagfish along the East Coast. 
      There has been little to no information of the life history of hagfish including 
      growth rate, age determination, reproductive biology, life span, and larval size at 
      hatching. Thus, the level at which a sustainable fisheries for this species can be 
      maintained is unknown. In some parts of the world, hagfish stocks are being depleted 
      due to overfishing. In order for fisheries management to manage its hagfish stocks 
      and develop a sustainable commercial hagfish fishery, critical information is needed 
      to assist in determining the optimal use of this valuable resource.Key elements of 
      the reproductive system have not been elucidated in hagfish. However, there is new 
      evidence from recent reproductive studies that Atlantic hagfish may have a seasonal 
      reproductive cycle. These data include seasonal changes in gonadotropin-releasing 
      hormone (GnRH), gonadal steroids, estradiol and progesterone, corresponding to 
      gonadal reproductive stages along with the putative identity of a functional corpus 
      luteum. This newly acquired data may provide important information to fisheries 
      managers of the East Coast.

TI  - Fiber-Enforced Hydrogels: Hagfish Slime Stabilized with Biopolymers including 
      κ-Carrageenan.
PG  - 90-95
LID - 10.1021/acsbiomaterials.5b00404 [doi]
AB  - Hagfish slime, a remarkable soft and elastic hydrogel, is formed by hagfish as a 
      defense mechanism against predation. The extremely fast slime formation, the high 
      water content, and protein threads up to 30 cm in length make it a promising 
      material for the development of hydrogels with embedded fibers. However, under 
      environmental conditions, i.e., in agitation in seawater, the slime collapses. To 
      address the limited structural stability but use the potential of the protein 
      threads as a backbone in fiber enforced materials, we generated composite structures 
      of hagfish slime with biopolymers. Hagfish slime mixed with chitosan reveals that 
      the slime's mucin fraction has a negative charge due to strong aggregation of both 
      components. The gels formed by κ-carrageenan and starch show synergistic effects by 
      exhibiting high values of water content, elasticity, and viscosity. We demonstrated 
      that in combination with negatively charged biopolymers, fiber enforced hydrogels 
      can be formed. This fiber enforced material has a pronounced cohesiveness and 
      stability, thus combining both properties of biopolymers and hagfish slime.

TI  - Analysis of fluid dynamics in perfused glomeruli of the hagfish eptatretus stouti 
      (Lockington).
PG  - 3097-104
AB  - The capillary tuft of glomeruli of the hagfish mesonephros contains both 
      'low'-pressure and 'high'-pressure glomerular vessels (LPGVs and HPGVs). The 
      existence of the HPGV raised the possibility that pressure filtration could occur in 
      the hagfish kidney when the blood pressure was sufficiently high. Therefore, 
      measurements of glomerular capillary pressure were made in HPGVs and LPGVs whilst 
      single glomeruli were perfused with hagfish Ringer's solution that contained the 
      colloid Ficoll 70. Calculations of the effective colloid osmotic pressure in 
      perfused capillaries were made; these showed that hydrostatic pressures within the 
      HPGV were inadequate to effect pressure filtration except at high rates of 
      perfusion. However, high rates of perfusion provoked perfusion pressures that 
      exceeded the highest values measured in the renal blood supply of lightly 
      anaesthetised hagfish. It was concluded that some process other than pressure 
      filtration must account for formation of the primary urine by hagfish glomeruli. The 
      proportion of the perfusate that became urine, the single glomerulus filtration 
      fraction (SGFF), bore a strong positive relationship to the vascular resistance of 
      perfused glomeruli. Both the SGFF and the vascular resistance were inversely related 
      to the rate of perfusion except when that rate was very high. From these two 
      observations it was concluded that at least two flow pathways exist in hagfish 
      glomeruli: one that has a high vascular resistance and that contributes to the 
      elaboration of the urine, and one that has a low vascular resistance and does not 
      contribute to urine formation. The possible anatomical location of the various flow 
      pathways through hagfish glomeruli and how they may function are discussed.

LID - 751876
AB  - Jawless fishes were the first vertebrates to evolve. It is thus important to 
      investigate them to determine whether consciousness was acquired in the common 
      ancestor of all vertebrates. Most jawless fish lineages are extinct, and cyclostomes 
      (lampreys and hagfish) are the sole survivors. Here, I review the empirical 
      knowledge on the neurobiology of cyclostomes with special reference to recently 
      proposed "markers" of primary, minimal consciousness. The adult lamprey appears to 
      meet the neuroanatomical criteria but there is a practical limitation to behavioral 
      examination of its learning ability. In addition, the consciousness-related 
      neuroarchitecture of larvae and its reconstruction during metamorphosis remain 
      largely uninvestigated. Even less is known of hagfish neurobiology. The hagfish 
      forebrain forms the central prosencephalic complex, and the homology of its 
      components to the brain regions of other vertebrates needs to be confirmed using 
      modern techniques. Nevertheless, as behavioral responses to olfactory stimuli in 
      aquariums have been reported, it is easier to investigate the learning ability of 
      the hagfish than that of the lamprey. Based on these facts, I finally discuss the 
      potential future directions of empirical studies for examining the existence of 
      consciousness in jawless fishes.

PG  - 20
LID - 10.1186/s40851-016-0057-0 [doi]
LID - 20
AB  - BACKGROUND: The taxonomic position of the Middle Devonian fish-like animal 
      Palaeospondylus has remained enigmatic, due mainly to the inability to identify 
      homologous cranial elements. This animal has been classified into nearly all of the 
      major vertebrate taxa over a century of heuristic taxonomic research, despite the 
      lack of conclusive morphological evidence. RESULTS: Here we report the first 
      comparative morphological analysis of hagfish embryos and Palaeospondylus, and a 
      hitherto overlooked resemblance in the chondrocranial elements of these animals; 
      i.e., congruence in the arrangement of the nasal capsule, neurocranium and 
      mandibular arch-derived velar bar. The large ventral skeletal complex of 
      Palaeospondylus is identified as a cyclostome-specific lingual apparatus. 
      Importantly, the overall morphological pattern of the Palaeospondylus cranium 
      coincides well with the cyclostome pattern of craniofacial development, which is not 
      shared with that of crown gnathostomes. Previously, the presence of the vertebral 
      column in Palaeospondylus made its assignment problematic, but the recent 
      identification of this vertebral element in hagfish is consistent with an affinity 
      between this group and Palaeospondylus. CONCLUSION: These lines of evidence support 
      the hagfish affinity of Palaeospondylus. Moreover, based on the less specialized 
      features in its cranial morphology, we conclude that Palaeospondylus is likely a 
      stem hagfish.

TI  - Haemoglobin H+ equilibria in lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis) and hagfish (Myxine 
      glutinosa).
PG  - 1963-8
AB  - Agnathans, comprising lamprey and hagfish species, have been reported to be 
      practically devoid of HCO3-/Cl- exchange across the red blood cell membrane. This 
      suggests that the capacity of their haemoglobin (Hb) to remove H+ is essential for 
      obtaining a high CO2-carrying capacity in the blood. Hydrogen ion titrations were 
      performed on oxygenated and deoxygenated composite Hbs from river lamprey and from 
      Atlantic hagfish at 15 degrees C and an ionic strength of 0.1 (0.1 mol l-1 KCl). 
      Lamprey Hb was characterised by very low buffer values when the degree of 
      oxygenation was constant, whereas the fixed-acid Haldane effect was large (uptake of 
      approximately 0.9 H+ per monomer upon deoxygenation). Hagfish Hb, in contrast, had 
      large buffer values and a moderate fixed-acid Haldane effect. In deoxygenated Hb, 
      the low buffer values in lamprey correlated with the presence of only 1-1.5 
      titratable 'neutral' groups (normally histidines and &agr; -amino groups) per 
      monomer, whereas there were 4-5 titratable 'neutral' groups per monomer in hagfish. 
      The large differences in Hb/H+ equilibria between the two species reflect the early 
      evolutionary divergence between lampreys and hagfish. With respect to CO2 transport, 
      the special Hb/H+ equilibria and the high red blood cell pH in lamprey ensure a high 
      concentration of free HCO3- inside the red cells in venous blood, which compensates 
      for the absence of a shift of HCO3- to the plasma. The Hb/H+ equilibria in hagfish 
      are less effective in ensuring a high CO2-carrying capacity given the virtual 
      absence of a red blood cell HCO3-/Cl- exchange, and other adaptations may be 
      involved.

TI  - Evolution of the lamin protein family at the base of the vertebrate lineage.
PG  - 37-44
LID - 10.1007/s00441-019-03156-x [doi]
AB  - Lamin proteins are major constituents of the nuclear lamina. They are required for 
      fundamental nuclear activities, as evidenced by the large number of laminopathies. 
      Mutations in the human lamin A/C gene exhibit a broad spectrum of clinical 
      manifestations. Most non-vertebrates including the nearest relatives of the 
      vertebrates have only a single lamin gene. In jawed vertebrates (Gnathostomata), 
      four lamin subtypes (B1, B2, LIII, and A) are found. Lampreys and hagfish form the 
      two orders of jawless vertebrates, Agnatha, which represent the sister group of the 
      Gnathostomata at the base of the vertebrate lineage. Lamin sequence information of 
      lampreys and hagfish sheds light on the evolution of the lamin protein family at the 
      base of the vertebrate lineage. In the genomes of the lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) 
      and the hagfish (Eptatretus burgeri), only three lamin genes are present, a lamin A 
      gene is lacking. The presence of an LIII gene in both, lampreys and hagfish, proves 
      that the distinguishing features of this gene had been established before the 
      agnathan/gnathostome split. The other two agnathan lamins, LmnI and LmnII, deviate 
      strongly in their sequences from those of the gnathostome lamins. For none of these 
      two agnathan lamins can orthology be established to one of the gnathostome lamin 
      types. In the direct chromosomal neighbourhood of all three hagfish lamin genes, a 
      MARCH3 paralog is found. This can be interpreted as further evidence that the 
      vertebrate lamin genes have arisen in the course of the two rounds of whole genome 
      duplication that took place at the base of the vertebrate lineage.

TI  - Some observations on cardiac automatism in certain animals.
PG  - 289-302
AB  - Certain aspects of the acetylcholine hypothesis of cardiac automaticity have been 
      tested in vitro with spontaneously beating cardiac tissue from rabbits, rats, dams, 
      and hagfish. The beat of atria from rabbits and rats may be depressed or excited by 
      acetylcholine, depending upon the state of the tissue. Proguanil and cocaine 
      inhibition of the beat in the rat may be antagonized by acetylcholine so that 
      reversal of the depression occurs. The action of acetylcholine on the hearts of 
      clams was found to be strictly inhibitory. Proguanil and cocaine, in contrast to 
      their action on mammalian atria, exert a stimulatory effect on the heart of the 
      molluscs studied. In fact, cocaine stimulated these hearts when they were inhibited 
      by acetylcholine. Studies on the non-innervated hagfish heart revealed that this 
      tissue is completely insensitive to the action of acetylcholine. Extracts prepared 
      from beating hearts of this species will accelerate hypodynamic hearts of the 
      hagfish as well as of the mussel. An extract of the neurogenic lobster heart was 
      without effect on the hagfish heart. Proguanil was likewise ineffective in 
      concentrations which produced inhibition and excitation in rat and clam hearts 
      respectively. It was concluded that acetylcholine does not play a role in the 
      myogenic automatism of all species, and that another mechanism is responsible is 
      suggested on the basis of results obtained in the hagfish hearts.

      implications of a primitive heart isozyme.
PG  - 769-70
AB  - Isozymes of lactate dehydrogenase from heart and muscle of Atlantic hagfish show 
      less functional divergence than those from other fishes and higher vertebrates. The 
      enzyme from hagfish heart (B4) displays a higher Michaelis constant for pyruvate and 
      lower substrate inhibition at moderate pyruvate concentrations than heart isozymes 
      from other species. These properties support the hypothesis that the ancestral 
      vertebrate lactate dehydrogenase was a muscle (A4)-type enzyme and also suggest a 
      role for the B4 enzyme in the unusual physiology of hagfish cardiac tissue which 
      functions under sustained hypoxic conditions.

      duplications.
PG  - 352-361
LID - 10.1093/bfgp/ely008 [doi]
AB  - Inferring the phenotype of the last common ancestor of living vertebrates is a 
      challenging problem because of several unresolvable factors. They include the lack 
      of reliable out-groups of living vertebrates, poor information about less 
      fossilizable organs and specialized traits of phylogenetically important species, 
      such as lampreys and hagfishes (e.g. secondary loss of vertebrae in adult 
      hagfishes). These factors undermine the reliability of ancestral reconstruction by 
      traditional character mapping approaches based on maximum parsimony. In this 
      article, we formulate an approach to hypothesizing ancestral vertebrate phenotypes 
      using information from the phylogenetic and functional properties of genes 
      duplicated by genome expansions in early vertebrate evolution. We named the 
      conjecture as 'chronological reconstruction of ohnolog functions (CHROF)'. This 
      CHROF conjecture raises the possibility that the last common ancestor of living 
      vertebrates may have had more complex traits than currently thought.

TI  - FMRF-amide-like immunoreactivity in brain and pituitary of the hagfish Eptatretus 
      burgeri (Cyclostomata).
PG  - 363-6
AB  - Paraffin sections of brain and pituitary of the hagfish Eptatretus burgeri were 
      immunostained with an antiserum to FMRF-amide. Immunoreactivity was visible in a 
      large number of neurons in the posterior part of the ventromedial hypothalamus and 
      in long neuronal processes extending cranially from the hypothalamus to the 
      olfactory system and caudally to the medulla oblongata. FMRF-amide-like 
      immunoreactivity was also found in cells of the adenohypophysis. These observations 
      suggest that the hagfish possesses a brain FMRF-amide-like transmitter system and 
      pituitary cells containing FMRF-amide-like material. Antisera to ACTH, alpha-MSH and 
      pancreatic polypeptide gave no immunoreaction in hagfish brain or pituitary.

TI  - Distribution of creatine, guanidinoacetate and the enzymes for their biosynthesis in 
      the animal kingdom. Implications for phylogeny.
PG  - 325-45
AB  - 1. The distribution of creatine and the creatine-synthesizing enzymes in the animal 
      kingdom has been investigated. Creatine was found in tissues of all vertebrates 
      examined, and in various invertebrates from phyla Annelida, Echinodermata, 
      Hemichordata and Chordata, subphylum Cephalochordata. The activities of the 
      creatine-synthesizing enzymes, arginine-glycine transamidinase and guanidinoacetate 
      methylpherase, were not detected in the hagfish or in any of the invertebrates, 
      including those in which creatine was found, with the exception that transamidinase 
      activities were detected in the amphioxus and salt water clam; however, these 
      activities are considered to be artifacts for reasons mentioned in the text. 
      Additional evidence that the hagfish and various creatine-containing invertebrates 
      could not synthesize creatine was the observation that these animals did not convert 
      one or the other of the likely precursors of creatine (arginine and glycine) into 
      creatine, in vivo. Further, the inability of these animals to synthesize creatine is 
      correlated with the observations that all animals tested were able to abstract 
      creatine from their aqueous environment. 2. The activities of the 
      creatine-synthesizing enzymes were detected in the sea lamprey and in all but a few 
      of the other vertebrates examined. Neither activity could be detected in the sharks 
      and rays (cartilaginous fish), buffalo fish (bony fish) or the snapping turtle. 
      Transamidinase or guanidinoacetate methylpherase activity could not be found in the 
      salamander or garter snake, respectively. 3. The results obtained with the lamprey 
      are in direct contrast with those obtained with the hagfish (both subphylum Agnatha, 
      class Cyclostomata). The lamprey had the ability to synthesize creatine and did not 
      abstract creatine from lake water. The hagfish did not have any apparent ability to 
      synthesize creatine and did abstract creatine from sea water. The present report 
      thus supports the theory that the myxinoid (hagfish) and petromyzoid (lamprey) 
      agnathans are only distantly related. 4. The lack of creatine-synthesizing enzyme 
      activities in the cartilaginous fishes may have phylogenetic significance, but may 
      also be explained by the availability of creatine in the diet of these animals. The 
      lack of one or both enzyme activities in vertebrates other than the hagfish and the 
      cartilaginous fish is suggested to be the result of creatine in the diet.

TI  - Calcitonin-immunoreactive cells are present in the brains of some cyclostomes.
PG  - 284-90
AB  - In the brains of four species of cyclostomes (two species each of lampreys and 
      hagfishes), immunoreactive calcitonin-producing cells (iCT cells) were located 
      immunohistochemically by the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method using anti-salmon 
      calcitonin antiserum. In the case of both the adults and the ammocoetes of the brook 
      lamprey (Lampetra reissneri) which lives in freshwater throughout its life, iCT 
      cells were found in two distinct areas: in the pars ventralis hypothalami of the 
      diencephalon and in the torus semicircularis of the mesencephalon. The iCT cells in 
      the diencephalon are classified as bipolar nerve cells, and those in the 
      mesencephalon are classified as multipolar nerve cells. In both the anadromous and 
      catadromous arctic lamprey (Lampetra japonica), iCT cells were present only in the 
      diencephalon, and those were bipolar nerve cells. There seemed to be no differences 
      in the numbers and the immunostainability of the iCT cells, despite the different 
      environments inhabited by the lampreys. In the hagfishes (Eptatretus burgeir and 
      Paramyxine atami) that inhabit seawater throughout their lives, iCT cells were also 
      found only in the diencephalon, although they were very few in number and exhibited 
      poor immunostainability.

AB  - Hagfish feed by immersing themselves in the body cavities of decaying animals. This 
      ensures a rich nutrient source for absorption via the gills, skin, and gut, but it 
      may also subject hagfish to reduced levels of dissolved oxygen and elevated levels 
      of the products of biological degradation. This study investigated the impacts of 
      hypoxia and ammonia on the assimilation and metabolism of selected nutrients 
      (glycine, l-alanine, and glucose) in Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii). 
      Throughout exposure to hypoxia, plasma glucose levels increased. This was not 
      accompanied by an increase in gut glucose transport, which suggests mobilization of 
      glucose from body glycogen stores. Hypoxia preexposure enhanced glycine absorption 
      across the gut and the gill, although l-alanine uptake was unchanged in these 
      tissues. A 24-h period of exposure to hypoxia in hagfish concurrently exposed to 
      waterborne radio-labeled glycine led to a large (5.7-fold) increase in brain glycine 
      accumulation. Preexposure to high levels of waterborne ammonia (10 mM) for 24 h had 
      no impact on gut or skin glycine uptake. These results indicate that hagfish are 
      adapted to maintain nutrient assimilation despite environmental stressors and that 
      tissue-specific absorption of key nutrients such as glycine can even be enhanced in 
      order to sustain critical functions during hypoxia.

AB  - Hagfish exudate is a natural biological macromolecule made of keratin intermediate 
      filament protein skeins and mucin vesicles. Here, we successfully examined this 
      remarkable biomaterial as a substrate for three-dimensional (3D) cell culturing 
      purposes. After the sterilization with chloroform vapor, Dulbecco's modified eagle 
      medium was mixed with the exudate to rupture the vesicles and skeins; a highly soft, 
      adherent, fibrous and biocompatible hydrogel was formed. A variety of cells, 
      including Hela-FUCCI, NMuMG-FUCCI, 10T1/2 and C2C12, was cultured on the hagfish 
      exudate. A remarkable 3D growth by ~2.5 folds after day 3, ~5 folds after day 5, ~10 
      folds after day 7 and ~15 folds after day 14 were seen compared to day one of 
      culturing in the hagfish exudate scaffold. In addition, the phase contrast, 
      fluorescent and confocal microscopy observations confirmed the organoid shape 
      formation within the three-week culture. The viability of cells was almost 100% 
      indicating the great in vitro and in vivo potential of this exceptional biomaterial 
      with no cytotoxic effect.

AB  - The vertebrate eye is a vital sensory organ that has long fascinated scientists, but 
      the details of how this organ evolved are still unclear. The vertebrate eye is 
      distinct from the simple photoreceptive organs of other non-vertebrate chordates and 
      there are no clear transitional forms of the eye in the fossil record. To 
      investigate the evolution of the eye we can examine the eyes of the most ancient 
      extant vertebrates, the hagfish and lamprey. These jawless vertebrates are in an 
      ideal phylogenetic position to study the origin of the vertebrate eye but data on 
      eye/retina development in these organisms is limited. New genomic and gene 
      expression data from hagfish and lamprey suggest they have many of the same genes 
      for eye development and retinal neurogenesis as jawed vertebrates, but functional 
      work to determine if these genes operate in retinogenesis similarly to other 
      vertebrates is missing. In addition, hagfish express a marker of proliferative 
      retinal cells (Pax6) near the margin of the retina, and adult retinal growth is 
      apparent in some species. This finding of eye growth late into hagfish ontogeny is 
      unexpected given the degenerate eye phenotype. Further studies dissecting retinal 
      neurogenesis in jawless vertebrates would allow for comparison of the mechanisms of 
      retinal development between cyclostome and gnathostome eyes and provide insight into 
      the evolutionary origins of the vertebrate eye.

TI  - Vascular architecture and intestinal hematopoietic nests of two cyclostomes, 
      Eptatretus burgeri and ammoncoetes of Entosphenus reissneri: a comparative 
      morphological study.
PG  - 71-93
AB  - Vascular architecture and the structure of the intestinal hematopoietic centers of 
      two cyclostomes, the hagfish Eptatretus burgeri and the ammocoetes larva of 
      Entosphenus reissneri, are compared. Blood cells of the hagfish are generated in 
      hematopoietic nests that develop around intestinal veins established primarily for 
      transport of absorbed nutrients. In ammocoetes, on the other hand, blood cells are 
      generated in hematopoietic nests of the typhlosole, closely associated with venous 
      sinusoids developing around the longitudinally oriented mesenteric artery of the 
      typhlosole. A collateral vein of the mesenteric artery is completed in the 
      typhlosole after metamorphosis. Since the spleen of higher vertebrates develops in 
      relation to establishment of the collateral vein of the largest foregut artery, the 
      intestinal hematopoietic nests of ammocoetes may be regarded as a model of the 
      primitive form of the spleen of higher vertebrates. Hematopoiesis in the hagfish 
      intestine is not related to establishment of a collateral vein; hence "primitive 
      spleen" or "intestinal spleen" may be improper terms in reference to the intestinal 
      hematopoietic tissue of the hagfish. Morphological characteristics of the 
      hematopoietic nests of the two cyclostomes are essentially the same. Blood cells of 
      these nests are generated in the intervenous tissue, supported by interstitial 
      connective tissue cells and reticulin fibers. Granulated cells are the most common 
      type in the primitive hematopoietic nests. No definitive erythrothrombocytopoiesis 
      has been identified. Lymphocytes have not been observed in the hagfish; however, 
      small lymphocytes have been observed in the vascular lumen of sinusoids around the 
      hematopoietic nests of ammocoetes. These lymphocytes probably originate outside of 
      the typhlosole.

TI  - A study of triiodothyronine-catecholamine interactions: their effect on plasma fatty 
      acids in Pacific hagfish Eptatretus stouti.
PG  - 767-72
AB  - Plasma circulating levels of fatty acids (PFA) were measured in intact and in 
      triiodothyronine (T3)-treated Pacific hagfish Eptatretus stouti. Intraperitoneal 
      injection of both pharmacological (200 ng/g) and physiological (1 ng/g) doses of T3 
      caused an elevation of PFA 24 and 48 hr after treatment. The implantation of 
      capsules containing the antithyroid compound, 6-propylthiouracil (6-PTU) decreased 
      PFA levels. Twenty-four hr after T3-injection the norepinephrine (NE) content of 
      plasma declined, whereas epinephrine (E) titres increased. Forty-eight hr after 
      T3-treatment the mean titres of dopamine (D) and NE were lower than in the control 
      group of hagfish. The treatment of hagfish with E in either pharmacological (2-3 
      micrograms/g) or physiological (2-3 ng/g) doses did not cause any elevation of PFA 
      during the 72 hr following injection. In the same experiment the high dose of E 
      induced long-lasting hyperglycemia, whereas the low dose had no substantial effect 
      on glycemic levels. The data provide evidence that in hagfish, unlike in higher 
      animals, the observed lipolytic effect of administered T3 is not mediated through 
      the potentiation of the fat mobilizing action of catecholamines.

TI  - The Hagfish Gland Thread Cell: A Fiber-Producing Cell Involved in Predator Defense.
LID - 10.3390/cells5020025 [doi]
LID - 25
AB  - Fibers are ubiquitous in biology, and include tensile materials produced by 
      specialized glands (such as silks), extracellular fibrils that reinforce 
      exoskeletons and connective tissues (such as chitin and collagen), as well as 
      intracellular filaments that make up the metazoan cytoskeleton (such as F-actin, 
      microtubules, and intermediate filaments). Hagfish gland thread cells are unique in 
      that they produce a high aspect ratio fiber from cytoskeletal building blocks within 
      the confines of their cytoplasm. These threads are elaborately coiled into 
      structures that readily unravel when they are ejected into seawater from the slime 
      glands. In this review we summarize what is currently known about the structure and 
      function of gland thread cells and we speculate about the mechanism that these cells 
      use to produce a mechanically robust fiber that is almost one hundred thousand times 
      longer than it is wide. We propose that a key feature of this mechanism involves the 
      unidirectional rotation of the cell's nucleus, which would serve to twist 
      disorganized filaments into a coherent thread and impart a torsional stress on the 
      thread that would both facilitate coiling and drive energetic unravelling in 
      seawater.

TI  - Adenosine receptor blockade and hypoxia-tolerance in rainbow trout and Pacific 
      hagfish. I. Effects on anaerobic metabolism.
PG  - 485-95
AB  - The physiological properties of adenosine may be essential in the control of energy 
      metabolism for the survival of animals exposed to oxygen shortages. Accordingly, we 
      tested the hypothesis that adenosine modulates metabolic regulation in rainbow trout 
      and Pacific hagfish exposed to acute hypoxia. Treatment of hypoxic rainbow trout 
      (PwO2=3.33 or 4.00 kPa) with the adenosine receptor (AR) blocker theophylline was 
      associated with greater increases in plasma [lactate], more rapid and pronounced 
      metabolic acidosis, higher tissue [lactate], and lower heart creatine charge and 
      glycogen content than in the hypoxic controls. The recruitment of anaerobic 
      metabolism in hypoxic trout treated with enprofylline, an AR blocker with very weak 
      affinity, was intermediate to that of the hypoxic theophylline-injected and control 
      groups. In hagfish, plasma [lactate] increased following exposure to a PwO2 of 1.33 
      kPa but did not increase following exposure to 3.33 kPa and, like plasma acidosis, 
      it was greatest in the animals treated with theophylline. These findings indicate 
      that AR blockade results in a more rapid and pronounced recruitment of anaerobic 
      metabolism following acute hypoxic exposure, and while rainbow trout and Pacific 
      hagfish show marked differences in their responses to hypoxia, adenosine appears to 
      play an important protective role in both species.

TI  - Fine Structure of Spermatozoa of the Hagfish Eptatretus burgeri (Agnatha)1.
PG  - 6-12
LID - 10.2307/1542195 [doi]
AB  - Live motile spermatozoa of the hagfish Eptatretus burgeri were obtained for the 
      first time, and their fine structure was examined. The spermatozoon is characterized 
      by an extremely long midpiece. Two of the four midpiece mitochondria are extensively 
      elongated and extend through almost the entire length of the tail. The acrosome 
      contains electron-dense and less dense materials in two different compartments. 
      Amorphous subacrosomal material lies between the acrosome and the nucleus. No 
      distinct perforatorium rod or filamentous structure was observed within the 
      subacrosomal material. Two centrioles lie almost end to end in the nuclear fossa 
      near the posterior end of the nucleus. The structure of the acrosomal complex in the 
      hagfish, which is quite different from that in the lamprey, was compared to that of 
      other chordates with respect to its function in sperm-egg interaction and phylogeny.

TI  - Secretion of primary urine by glomeruli of the hagfish kidney.
PG  - 947-55
AB  - Adrenaline and noradrenaline increased the perfusion pressure (Pperf) and single 
      glomerulus filtration rate (SGFR) of perfused hagfish glomeruli. Small amounts (0.1 
      % or 0.5 %) of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in perfusion fluids containing Ficoll 70 
      did not diminish the loss of colloid from hagfish glomerular capillaries as has been 
      reported for other perfused capillaries. However, replacement of Ficoll 70 with an 
      osmotically equivalent amount (3 %) of BSA appreciably reduced colloid loss. It was 
      concluded that adrenaline and colloids enhanced flow through the urine-forming 
      capillaries. Whereas adrenaline elevated the SGFR, colloid lowered the SGFR probably 
      by a direct effect on the fluid permeability of the capillary walls. The 
      flow-enhancing effect of adrenaline was used to ensure the exposure of urine-forming 
      capillaries to two inhibitors of active fluid transport, ouabain and 
      2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP). Both substances lowered the single glomerulus filtration 
      fraction (SGFF), probably by affecting a fluid secretion mechanism. In addition, DNP 
      diminished the flow-enhancing effect of adrenaline. This study provides relatively 
      unequivocal evidence that fluid secretion underlies the formation of primary urine 
      by the hagfish.

TI  - Adenosine receptor blockade and hypoxia-tolerance in rainbow trout and Pacific 
      hagfish. II. Effects on plasma catecholamines and erythrocytes.
PG  - 497-507
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the role of adenosine receptors (ARs) in 
      (1) the regulation of catecholamine secretion and (2) the modulation of blood oxygen 
      capacitance by catecholamines. To this end, we assessed the response of rainbow 
      trout and Pacific hagfish treated with either an AR blocker, theophylline, or saline 
      under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. Compared with the control hypoxic rainbow 
      trout, AR blockade resulted in a smaller increase in haematocrit and haemoglobin 
      (Hb) concentration of the blood, smaller red blood cell transmembrane pH differences 
      and mean cellular [Hb] (MCHC), as well as a 16-fold higher plasma adrenaline 
      concentration after only 10 min of acute hypoxic exposure. In hypoxic hagfish, AR 
      blockade had no effect on the [Hb] of the blood, and there was no regulation of red 
      blood cell pH or changes in MCHC. However, whereas plasma [adrenaline] did not 
      change following exposure to a PwO2 of 1.33 kPa in the hypoxic sham group, the 
      concentration increased 3.8-fold within 10 min in the theophylline-injected group. 
      These results suggest that adenosine modulates the circulating level of 
      catecholamines in both hypoxic rainbow trout and hypoxic Pacific hagfish.

TI  - Fossil sister group of craniates: predicted and found.
PG  - 1-31
AB  - This study investigates whether the recently described Cambrian fossil Haikouella 
      (and the very similar Yunnanozoon) throws light on the longstanding problem of the 
      origin of craniates. In the first rigorous cladistic analysis of the relations of 
      this animal, we took 40 anatomical characters from Haikouella and other taxa 
      (hemichordates, tunicates, cephalochordates, conodont craniates and other craniates, 
      plus protostomes as the outgroup) and subjected these characters to parsimony 
      analysis. The characters included several previously unrecognized traits of 
      Haikouella, such as upper lips resembling those of larval lampreys, the thick nature 
      of the branchial bars, a mandibular branchial artery but no mandibular branchial 
      bar, muscle fibers defining the myomeres, a dark fibrous sheath that defines the 
      notochord, conclusive evidence for paired eyes, and a large hindbrain and 
      diencephalon in the same positions as in the craniate brain. The cladistic analysis 
      produced this tree: (protostomes, hemichordates (tunicates, (cephalochordates, 
      (Haikouella, (conodonts + other craniates))))), with the "Haikouella + craniate" 
      clade supported by bootstrap values that ranged from 81-96%, depending on how the 
      analysis was structured. Thus, Haikouella is concluded to be the sister group of the 
      craniates. Alternate hypotheses that unite Haikouella with hemichordates or 
      cephalochordates, or consider it a basal deuterostome, received little or no 
      support. Although it is the sister group of craniates, Haikouella is skull-less and 
      lacks an ear, but it does have neural-crest derivatives in its branchial bars. Its 
      craniate characters occur mostly in the head and pharynx; its widely spaced, robust 
      branchial bars indicate it ventilated with branchiomeric muscles, not cilia. Despite 
      its craniate mode of ventilation, Haikouella was not a predator but a suspension 
      feeder, as shown by its cephalochordate-like endostyle, and tentacles forming a 
      screen across the mouth. Haikouella was compared to pre-craniates predicted by 
      recent models of craniate evolution and was found to fit these predictions closely. 
      Specifically, it fits Northcutt and Gans' prediction that the change from ciliary to 
      muscular ventilation preceded the change from suspension feeding to predatory 
      feeding; it fits Butler's claim that vision was the first craniate sense to start 
      elaborating; it is consistent with the ideas of Donoghue and others about the 
      ancestor of conodont craniates; and, most strikingly, it resembles Mallatt's 
      prediction of the external appearance of the ancestral craniate head. By contrast, 
      Haikouella does not fit the widespread belief that ancestral craniates resembled 
      hagfishes, because it has no special hagfish characters. Overall, Haikouella agrees 
      so closely with recent predictions about pre-craniates that we conclude that the 
      difficult problem of craniate origins is nearly solved.

AB  - The portal vein heart (PVH) wall of the brown hagfish (Paramyxine atami) was 
      observed by light and transmission electron microscopy. Cardiac musculature is well 
      developed in the PVH wall. The myocytes possess arranged myofibrils in the 
      cytoplasm. We suggest that the PVH may act as a pump in blood circulation from the 
      intestines to the liver, as it does in other myxinoid species. Ultrastructural and 
      immunohistochemical findings of the brown hagfish PVH myocytes also indicate that 
      the PVH has an active contraction and atrial natriuretic polypeptide endocrine 
      function. J Morphol 231:225-230, 1997. © 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

TI  - Bactericidal antibody response in the Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii.
PG  - 160-6
AB  - The hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii, has been shown to synthesize bactericidal 
      antibodies after injections of gram-negative organisms. These bactericidins could be 
      detected as early as 2 days after the primary injection. Secondary responses were 
      accelerated, although titers were not significantly higher than those reached in the 
      primary response. The bactericidins of hagfish were found to react with other 
      gramnegative enteric bacteria, but not with gram-positive strains. The bactericidins 
      show a lesser degree of specificity and a shorter induction period than other 
      hagfish antibodies or most antibodies induced in higher vertebrates. The 
      bactericidal activity was temperature dependent and could be irreversibly destroyed 
      by heating at 50 C for 20 min. Immune sera were subjected to gel filtration on 
      Sephadex G-200, and bactericidal activity was found to be associated with the 
      excluded peak indicating a high-molecular-weight component. Evidence indicates that 
      inducible immune responses of this bactericidal type represent a primitive capacity 
      which arose before the emergence of vertebrate species.

TI  - Evolution of elastin structure.
PG  - 291-312
AB  - The aortae of a number of vertebrates and invertebrates were tested for the presence 
      of elastin to determine when this protein first appears phylogenetically. Using 
      several criteria, including amino acid composition, presence of desmosines, and 
      histological characteristics, we found that all representative vertebrate groups 
      have elastin except the primitive jawless fishes (lampreys and hagfishes). All the 
      invertebrates tested, representing most major phyla, were found lackin in elastin as 
      well. Comparison of purified elastins from several vertebrate groups reveals some 
      striking differences in their amino acid compositions and properties, including the 
      arrangement of the elastic fibers in the aorta. The patterns of variations in amino 
      acid composition suggest a mode of evolution which is different from the slow 
      accumulation of point mutations observed with globular proteins.

TI  - Hydrostatic pressures in glomeruli and renal vasculature of the hagfish, Eptatretus 
      stouti.
PG  - 359-71
AB  - Hydrostatic pressures in the renal vasculature of hagfish have been studied. 
      Estimates of the blood colloid osmotic pressure (COP) have been made. In blood 
      vessels supplying the renal corpuscles, the average hydrostatic pressure is about 1 
      kPa. The average hydrostatic pressure falls to a value of 0.04 kPa within the 
      postcardinal vein efferent to the renal corpuscle. Within the glomerular capillaries 
      the hydrostatic pressure averages 0.21 kPa. Since the blood COP averages about 1.4 
      kPa, it is clear that glomerular filtration in the hagfish is not underlain by the 
      hydrostatic pressure of the arterial pulse. In some blood vessels efferent to the 
      renal corpuscles, hydrostatic pressure may be as high as in the afferent supply. 
      Evidence is presented that the glomerular capillaries are shunted by this high 
      pressure vascular pathway.

TI  - [Hemoglobins. XXVII. The amino acid sequence of hemoglobin III from Myxine glutinosa 
      L. A new hemecomplex: E7 glutamine, E11 isoleucine].
PG  - 125-35
AB  - The sequence analysis of the main component, "HbIII", of the hemoglobins from the 
      hagfish (Myxine glutinosa L.) is described. The hagfish belongs to the Cyclostomata, 
      the most primitive class of the vertebrates. The hagfish hemoglobin displays a great 
      heterogeneity, as described earlier. It consists of several monomeric hemoglobins. 
      The globin of HbIII was isolated and used for the sequence analysis. The tryptic 
      peptides as well as the cyanogen bromide and the BNPS-skatol fragments were 
      separated. The sequences of the peptides were determined automatically by the help 
      of a sequenator. Compared with other hitherto analyzed vertebral hemoglobins, also 
      including other Cyclostomata, the primary structure of "HbIII" differs by more than 
      50%. The differences are so many that one can refer the Myxine hemoglobin neither as 
      an alpha- nor as a beta-chain (of the tetrameric hemoglobins). The hagfish 
      hemoglobin like other Cyclostomata has an additional segment of 9 residues at the 
      amino terminus end compared with the mammalian hemoglobins. In the F-helix there is 
      an insertion of 3 amino acid residues and in the interhelical gap, GH, there is a 
      deletion of 9 residues. The substitutions of the residues forming the heme complex 
      are of special interest. The distal histidine, E7, is substituted for glutamine. The 
      proximal histidine, F8, is invariable. The valine E11 is substituted by isoleucine 
      and the leucine FG3 by phenylalanine. These positions are involved in the contact 
      with the heme group. This complex has never been described before.

TI  - Early evolution of multifocal optics for well-focused colour vision in vertebrates.
PG  - 1559-64
LID - 10.1242/jeb.016048 [doi]
AB  - Jawless fishes (Agnatha; lampreys and hagfishes) most closely resemble the earliest 
      stage in vertebrate evolution and lamprey-like animals already existed in the Lower 
      Cambrian [about 540 million years ago (MYA)]. Agnathans are thought to have 
      separated from the main vertebrate lineage at least 500 MYA. Hagfishes have 
      primitive eyes, but the eyes of adult lampreys are well-developed. The southern 
      hemisphere lamprey, Geotria australis, possesses five types of opsin genes, three of 
      which are clearly orthologous to the opsin genes of jawed vertebrates. This suggests 
      that the last common ancestor of all vertebrate lineages possessed a complex colour 
      vision system. In the eyes of many bony fishes and tetrapods, well-focused colour 
      images are created by multifocal crystalline lenses that compensate for longitudinal 
      chromatic aberration. To trace the evolutionary origins of multifocal lenses, we 
      studied the optical properties of the lenses in four species of lamprey (Geotria 
      australis, Mordacia praecox, Lampetra fluviatilis and Petromyzon marinus), with 
      representatives from all three of the extant lamprey families. Multifocal lenses are 
      present in all lampreys studied. This suggests that the ability to create 
      well-focused colour images with multifocal optical systems also evolved very early.

TI  - Hagfish slime exudate stabilization and its effect on slime formation and 
      functionality.
PG  - 1115-1122
LID - 10.1242/bio.025528 [doi]
AB  - Hagfish produce vast amounts of slime when under attack. The slime is the most 
      dilute hydrogel known to date, and is a highly interesting material for biomaterial 
      research. It forms from a glandular secrete, called exudate, which deploys upon 
      contact with seawater. To study slime formation ex vivo and to characterize its 
      material properties, stabilization of the sensitive slime exudate is crucial. In 
      this study, we compared the two main stabilization methods, dispersion in high 
      osmolarity citrate/PIPES (CP) buffer and immersion in oil, and tested the influence 
      of time, temperature and pH on the stability of the exudate and functionality of the 
      slime. Using water retention measurements to assess slime functionality, we found 
      that CP buffer and oil preserved the exudate within the first 5 hours without loss 
      of functionality. For longer storage times, slime functionality decreased for both 
      stabilization methods, for which the breakdown mechanisms differed. Stabilization in 
      oil likely favored temperature-sensitive osmotic-driven swelling and rupture of the 
      mucin vesicles, causing the exudate to gel and clump. Extended storage in CP buffer 
      resulted in an inhibited unraveling of skeins. We suggest that a water soluble 
      protein glue, which mediates skein unraveling in functional skeins, denatures and 
      gradually becomes insoluble during storage in CP buffer. The breakdown was 
      accentuated when the pH of the CP buffer was raised from pH 6.7 to pH 8.5, probably 
      caused by increased denaturation of the protein glue or by inferior vesicle 
      stabilization. However, when fresh exudate was mixed into seawater or phosphate 
      buffer at pH 6-9, slime functionality was not affected, showing pH insensitivity of 
      the slime formation around a neutral pH. These insights on hagfish exudate 
      stabilization mechanisms will support hagfish slime research at a fundamental level, 
      and contribute to resolve the complex mechanisms of skein unraveling and slime 
      formation.

AB  - In this study, the complete mitochondrial DNA sequence of a hagfish Eptatretus sp. 
      Nan-Hai from a depth of 1000 m is presented. The complete sequence was determined 
      using next-generation sequencing and long PCRs. The mitochondrial genome of 
      Eptatretus sp. Nan-Hai is 17,538 bps in size and composed of 13 protein-coding 
      genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, and one control region 
      (D-loop). The base composition of mitochondrial genome is biased toward A + T 
      content, at 67.21%, with GC skew of -0.35 and AT skew of -0.03. A phylogenetic tree 
      revealed that within the genus Eptatretus, Eptatretus sp. Nan-Hai is closely related 
      to Eptatretus atami.

TI  - Corticotrophin-like bioactivity in the pituitary gland and brain of the pacific 
      hagfish, Eptatretus stouti.
PG  - 434-7
AB  - The cytochemical bioassay for corticotrophin (ACTH) was used in an attempt to detect 
      ACTH-like activity in the Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stouti. Extracts of the 
      pituitary gland and brain were active in this assay system but those of liver and 
      skeletal muscles were not. The slopes of the dose-response lines of the pituitary 
      extracts were less than those of the mammalian corticotrophin standard preparation 
      but greater than those of the brain extracts. The results suggest that the 
      corticotrophic factor in the hagfish differs from mammalian ACTH.

TI  - It's all in the gills: evaluation of O2 uptake in Pacific hagfish refutes a major 
      respiratory role for the skin.
PG  - 2814-2818
AB  - Hagfish skin has been reported as an important site for ammonia excretion and as the 
      major site of systemic oxygen acquisition. However, whether cutaneous O(2) uptake is 
      the dominant route of uptake remains under debate; all evidence supporting this 
      hypothesis has been derived using indirect measurements. Here, we used partitioned 
      chambers and direct measurements of oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion to 
      quantify cutaneous and branchial exchanges in Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii) 
      at rest and following exhaustive exercise. Hagfish primarily relied on the gills for 
      both O(2) uptake (81.0%) and ammonia excretion (70.7%). Following exercise, both 
      O(2) uptake and ammonia excretion increased, but only across the gill; cutaneous 
      exchange was not increased. When branchial O(2) availability was reduced by exposure 
      to anteriorly localized hypoxia (∼4.6 kPa O(2)), cutaneous O(2) consumption was only 
      slightly elevated on an absolute basis. These results refute a major role for 
      cutaneous O(2) acquisition in the Pacific hagfish.

TI  - Multiple gene loci for the monomeric hemoglobin of the hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii).
PG  - 1034-5
AB  - The fact that members of the subclass Cyclotomata possess monomeric hemoglobin 
      molecules has been known for some time. Electrophoresis of hemolysates from 12 
      hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii) revealed five hemoglobin phenotypes with four to six 
      distinct zones of hemoglobin. Each zone is believed to represent a monomer 
      containing one heme group on a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of 
      approximately 18,000. It is postulated that these monomers are controlled by genes 
      at four loci.

TI  - Ribosomal RNA genes and deuterostome phylogeny revisited: more cyclostomes, 
      elasmobranchs, reptiles, and a brittle star.
PG  - 1005-22
AB  - This is an expanded study of the relationships among the deuterostome animals based 
      on combined, nearly complete 28S and 18S rRNA genes (>3925 nt.). It adds sequences 
      from 20 more taxa to the approximately 45 sequences used in past studies. Seven of 
      the new taxa were sequenced here (brittle star Ophiomyxa, lizard Anolis, turtle 
      Chrysemys, sixgill shark Hexanchus, electric ray Narcine, Southern Hemisphere 
      lamprey Geotria, and Atlantic hagfish Myxine for 28S), and the other 13 were from 
      GenBank and the literature (from a chicken, dog, rat, human, three lungfishes, and 
      several ray-finned fishes, or Actinopterygii). As before, our alignments were based 
      on secondary structure but did not account for base pairing in the stems of rRNA. 
      The new findings, derived from likelihood-based tree-reconstruction methods and by 
      testing hypotheses with parametric bootstrapping, include: (1) brittle star joins 
      with sea star in the echinoderm clade, Asterozoa; (2) with two hagfishes and two 
      lampreys now available, the cyclostome (jawless) fishes remain monophyletic; (3) 
      Hexanchiform sharks are monophyletic, as Hexanchus groups with the frilled shark, 
      Chlamydoselachus; (4) turtle is the sister taxon of all other amniotes; (5) bird is 
      closer to the lizard than to the mammals; (6) the bichir Polypterus is in a 
      monophyletic Actinopterygii; (7) Zebrafish Danio is the sister taxon of the other 
      two teleosts we examined (trout and perch); (8) the South American and African 
      lungfishes group together to the exclusion of the Australian lungfish. Other 
      findings either upheld those of the previous rRNA-based studies (e.g., echinoderms 
      and hemichordates group as Ambulacraria; orbitostylic sharks; batoids are not 
      derived from any living lineage of sharks) or were obvious (monophyly of mammals, 
      gnathostomes, vertebrates, echinoderms, etc.). Despite all these findings, the rRNA 
      data still fail to resolve the relations among the major groups of deuterostomes 
      (tunicates, Ambulacraria, cephalochordates and vertebrates) and of gnathostomes 
      (chondrichthyans, lungfishes, coelacanth, actinopterygians, amphibians, and 
      amniotes), partly because tunicates and lungfishes are rogue taxa that disrupt the 
      tree. Nonetheless, parametric bootstrapping showed our RNA-gene data are only 
      consistent with these dominant hypotheses: (1) deuterostomes consist of Ambulacraria 
      plus Chordata, with Chordata consisting of tunicates and 'vertebrates plus 
      cephalochordates'; and (2) lungfishes are the closest living relatives of tetrapods.

TI  - Do lampreys have lymphocytes? The Spi evidence.
PG  - 7417-22
AB  - It is generally accepted that living jawless vertebrates (lampreys and hagfishes) 
      lack the capability of mounting an adaptive immune response. At the same time, 
      however, there are reports describing histological evidence for the presence in 
      agnathan tissues of lymphocytes, the key players in adaptive immunity. The question 
      therefore arises whether the cells identified morphologically as lymphocytes are 
      true lymphocytes in terms of their genetic developmental program. In this study, 
      evidence is provided that the lampreys express a member of the purine box 1 
      (PU.1)/spleen focus-forming virus integration B (Spi-B) gene family known to be 
      critically and specifically involved in the differentiation of lymphocytes in jawed 
      vertebrates. The lamprey gene is expressed in the lymphocyte-like cells of the 
      digestive tract and inexplicably also in the ovary.

TI  - Partial characterization of vertebrate prothrombin cDNAs: amplification and sequence 
      analysis of the B chain of thrombin from nine different species.
PG  - 2779-83
AB  - The cDNA sequence of the B chain of thrombin (EC 3.4.21.5) has been determined from 
      nine vertebrate species (rat, mouse, rabbit, chicken, gecko, newt, rainbow trout, 
      sturgeon, and hagfish). The amino acid sequence identities vary from 96.5% (rat vs. 
      mouse) to 62.6% (newt vs. hagfish). Of the 240 amino acids spanned in all the 
      species compared, there is identity at 110 (45.8%) positions. When conservative 
      changes are included, the amino acid similarity increases to 75%. The most conserved 
      portions of the B chain are the active-site residues and adjacent amino acids, the B 
      loop, and the primary substrate-binding region. In addition, the Arg-Gly-Asp motif 
      is conserved in 9 of the 11 species compared, and the chemotactic/growth factor 
      domain is well conserved in all of the 11 species compared. The least conserved 
      regions of the B chain correspond to surface loops, including the putative 
      thrombomodulin-binding sites and one of the hirudin-binding regions. The extent of 
      the amino acid sequence similarity and the conservation of many of the 
      functional/structural motifs suggests that, in addition to their role in blood 
      coagulation, vertebrate thrombins may also play an important role in the general 
      mechanisms of wound repair.

PG  - 170214
LID - 10.1098/rsos.170214 [doi]
LID - 170214
AB  - Palaeospondylus gunni Traquair, 1890 is an enigmatic Devonian vertebrate whose 
      taxonomic affinities have been debated since it was first described. Most recently, 
      Palaeospondylus has been identified as a stem-group hagfish (Myxinoidea). However, 
      one character questioning this assignment is the presence of three semicircular 
      canals in the otic region of the cartilaginous skull, a feature of jawed 
      vertebrates. Additionally, new tomographic data reveal that the following characters 
      of crown-group gnathostomes (chondrichthyans + osteichthyans) are present in 
      Palaeospondylus: a longer telencephalic region of the braincase, separation of otic 
      and occipital regions by the otico-occipital fissure, and vertebral centra. As well, 
      a precerebral fontanelle and postorbital articulation of the palatoquadrate are 
      characteristic of certain chondrichthyans. Similarities in the structure of the 
      postorbital process to taxa such as Pucapampella, and possible presence of the 
      ventral cranial fissure, both support a resolution of Pa. gunni as a stem 
      chondrichthyan. The internally mineralized cartilaginous skeleton in Palaeospondylus 
      may represent a stage in the loss of bone characteristic of the Chondrichthyes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The liver architecture of vertebrates can be classified into two types, 
      the portal triad type (having periportal bile ducts) and the non-portal triad type 
      (having non-periportal bile ducts). The former is detectable from the hagfish, which 
      is the most ancestral vertebrate, to tetrapod livers whereas many actinopterygian 
      livers have the latter. The aim of the present study is to reveal the distribution 
      of smooth muscle tissue in livers of various vertebrates with attention to their 
      architectures. METHODS: Smooth muscle was immunohistochemically compared in hepatic 
      blood vessels and bile ducts of various vertebrates, using an anti-alpha-smooth 
      muscle actin (ASMA) antibody. RESULTS: Smooth muscle was noted in the gallbladder 
      and hepatic artery in all vertebrates, including the hagfish. Bile ducts having 
      ASMA-positive smooth muscles were absent in the hagfish, but detected in the 
      Chondrichthyes and conserved in actinopterygians with or without portal triads 
      during the evolution of vertebrates. In tetrapods having portal triads, reptiles had 
      a tendency to have strongly ASMA-positive biliary smooth muscle tissues whereas 
      other tetrapods had bile ducts with poor smooth muscle tissues. Although the hagfish 
      livers never had ASMA-positive smooth muscle tissue in the walls of portal and 
      central veins, it was observed in discontinuous distributions or not observed in 
      portal veins and central veins of chondrichthyans and actinopterygians. By contrast, 
      in most tetrapods, ASMA-positive smooth muscle tissue was detectable in portal 
      veins, which supported the adjacent endothelial cells as a circular layer. Central 
      veins did not consistently have smooth muscle tissue in these groups. DISCUSSION AND 
      CONCLUSION: The hagfish liver may retain more ancestral characteristics than other 
      vertebrates in terms of smooth muscle distribution in the vascular and biliary 
      systems. Actinopterygians might have a different mechanism of bile transport from 
      tetrapods from their smooth muscle distribution in intrahepatic bile ducts. The 
      circular smooth muscle distribution in portal veins might be a characteristic 
      acquired by tetrapods.

AB  - Agnathans (lamprey and hagfish) are a group of primitive jawless fish. Jawed 
      vertebrates possess adaptive immunity including immunoglobulins, while agnathans 
      lack immunoglobulins but have alternative adaptive immunity in which variable 
      lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) function as antibodies. The complement system consists 
      of many proteins involved in the elimination of pathogens. In mammals, it is 
      activated via the three different pathways, resulting in the generation of C3b 
      followed by the lytic pathway. Complement components including C3, mannose-binding 
      lectin (MBL), and MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP) of the lectin pathway and 
      factor B of the alternative pathway have been identified from lamprey and/or 
      hagfish, while lytic pathway components have not been identified. In mammals, C1q 
      binds to IgM/IgG-antigen complexes and activates the classical pathway in 
      association with C1r and C1s. Lamprey also has C1q (LC1q), but its function differs 
      from that of mammalian C1q. LC1q acts as a lectin and activates C3 in association 
      with MASP via the lectin pathway. Furthermore, LC1q may interact with a secreted 
      type of VLR (VLRB) in complex with antigens and mediate activation of C3, 
      potentially via MASP, leading to cytolysis. Cytolysis is mediated by a newly 
      identified serum protein named lamprey pore-forming protein (LPFP). In conclusion, 
      lamprey has a complement activation pathway, which could be regarded as the 
      classical pathway and also has a cytolytic system that is distinct from the 
      mammalian lytic pathway. Thus, it appears that the complement system of agnathans is 
      very unique and may have developed independently from jawed vertebrates.

TI  - Hagfish genome reveals parallel evolution of 7SL RNA-derived SINEs.
PG  - 18
LID - 10.1186/s13100-020-00210-2 [doi]
LID - 18
AB  - BACKGROUND: Short interspersed elements (SINEs) are ubiquitous components of 
      eukaryotic genomes. SINEs are composite transposable elements that are mobilized by 
      non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons, also called long interspersed 
      elements (LINEs). The 3' part of SINEs usually originated from that of counterpart 
      non-LTR retrotransposons. The 5' part of SINEs mostly originated from small RNA 
      genes. SINE1 is a group of SINEs whose 5' part originated from 7SL RNA, and is 
      represented by primate Alu and murine B1. Well-defined SINE1 has been found only 
      from Euarchontoglires, a group of mammals, in contrast to the wide distribution of 
      SINE2, which has a tRNA-derived sequence, from animals to plants to protists. Both 
      Alu and B1 are mobilized by L1-type non-LTR retrotransposons, which are the only 
      lineage of autonomous non-LTR retrotransposons active in these mammalian lineages. 
      RESULTS: Here a new lineage of SINE1 is characterized from the seashore hagfish 
      Eptatretus burgeri genome. This SINE1 family, designated SINE1-1_EBu, is young, and 
      is transposed by RTE-type non-LTR retrotransposon, not L1-type. Comparison with 
      other SINE families from hagfish indicated the birth of SINE1-1_EBu through chimera 
      formation of a 7SL RNA-derived sequence and an older tRNA-derived SINE family. It 
      reveals parallel evolution of SINE1 in two vertebrate lineages with different 
      autonomous non-LTR retrotransposon partners. The comparison between two SINE1 
      lineages supports that the RNA secondary structure of the Alu domain of 7SL RNA is 
      required for the efficient retrotransposition. CONCLUSIONS: The hagfish SINE1 is the 
      first evident SINE1 family found outside of Euarchontoglires. Independent evolution 
      of SINE1 with similar RNA secondary structure originated in 7SL RNA indicates the 
      functional importance of 7SL RNA-derived sequence in the proliferation of SINEs.

TI  - Control of catecholamine and serotonin release from the chromaffin tissue of the 
      Atlantic hagfish.
PG  - 2485-97
AB  - An in situ saline-perfused systemic heart/posterior cardinal vein preparation of the 
      Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) was used to assess (1) the ability of the 
      chromaffin tissue to release catecholamines in response to adrenocorticotropic 
      hormone (ACTH; 7.5 i.u. kg-1), serotonin (250 nmol kg-1), carbachol (100 &micro;mol 
      kg-1), [Asn1-Val5]angiotensin II (Ang II; 100 nmol kg-1), histamine (0.3&shy;300 
      &micro;mol l-1) and a high-[K+] saline (60 mmol l-1), (2) whether serotonin is 
      co-released with the catecholamines of the chromaffin tissues, and (3) the potential 
      modulatory effects of NECA, an adenosine receptor agonist, and DPSPX, an adenosine 
      receptor antagonist, on catecholamine release. Bolus injections of ACTH, serotonin 
      or carbachol, or perfusion with high-[K+] saline, all elicited the release of both 
      adrenaline and noradrenaline. Pre-treatment with the serotonergic receptor 
      antagonist methysergide or the cholinergic receptor antagonist hexamethonium 
      abolished the serotonin- and carbachol-mediated catecholamine releases, 
      respectively. Neither receptor antagonist affected the ACTH-mediated catecholamine 
      release. Bolus injections of Ang II or perfusion with a range of histamine 
      concentrations, two potent secretagogues in other vertebrates, did not elicit 
      catecholamine secretion in hagfish. While injections of Ang II or perfusion with the 
      high-[K+] saline both elicited the release of serotonin, treatments with ACTH, 
      carbachol or histamine did not. Hence, co-release of catecholamines and serotonin 
      was elicited by non-specific cell membrane depolarization using K+, but not by the 
      specific secretagogues assessed in this study. The adenosine receptor agonist NECA 
      and antagonist DPSPX significantly modified the secretory responses elicited by 
      ACTH, serotonin and carbachol. The results suggest that adenosine may inhibit 
      catecholamine release induced by serotonin or carbachol, while stimulating 
      ACTH-induced release. Although the contribution of the different secretagogues 
      identified in this study has yet to be explored in vivo, our results suggest that 
      the control of catecholamine and serotonin release from the aneural chromaffin 
      tissue of the Atlantic hagfish can be achieved through hormonal and/or paracrine 
      means.

PG  - 233-7
AB  - 1. The principal bile salt, myxinol disulphate, of two hagfish species, Eptatretus 
      stoutii and Myxine glutinosa, has been shown by chemical methods and by 
      optical-rotatory and mass-spectral considerations to be probably the 
      C-3,27-disulphate ester of 3beta,7alpha,16alpha,27-tetrahydroxy-5beta-cholestane. 2. 
      Myxine liver sterols were about half ;free' and half esterified: cholesterol only 
      was identified. 3. The chemical nature of myxinol is what might be expected for the 
      bile alcohol of a very primitive vertebrate.

TI  - The Agnathan ark: the origin of craniate brains.
PG  - 237-47
AB  - An outgroup analysis of head organization of tunicates, lancelets and craniates 
      indicates that the origin of craniates involved the development of a new muscular 
      pharyngeal pump, which was a key innovation underlying the evolution of a more 
      metabolically active group of chordates. This innovation involved the genesis of new 
      embryonic tissues, neural crest and neurogenic placodes, whose derivatives formed 
      skeletal elements of the new pump as well as new receptors advantageous to the more 
      mobile craniates. These changes also involved the evolution of a more complex brain 
      by elaboration and reorganization of a lancelet-like cephalic neural tube. All of 
      these events appear to be linked to a number of homeobox genes that were duplicated 
      in the ancestral chordates leading to craniates. An outgroup analysis of the life 
      histories of lancelets, hagfishes and lampreys suggests that hagfishes and lampreys 
      have life histories that are substantially derived in comparison to that of 
      ancestral craniates and that the highly derived features of the brain of hagfishes 
      evolved in conjunction with their invasion of a bathyal benthic environment.

AB  - The distribution of anionic groups of acid mucopolysaccharides on the surface of 
      glomerular constituents of a brown hagfish, Paramyxine atami Dean, has been studied 
      morphologically. The ionized anionic groups of acid mucopolysaccharides were labeled

      4.0. The glomerular permeability to cationic and anionic macromolecules was observed 
      morphologically in the kidney of the animal injected with native anionic ferritin 
      (NF) or cationized ferritin (CF) into the dorsal aorta. Histochemical staining of 
      tissues with Fe-Cac (pH 4.0) revealed the ionized anionic groups of acid 
      mucopolysaccharides on both luminal and abluminal surfaces of endothelial cells, 
      within the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), and on the visceral epithelial cell 
      surface facing the urinary space. The CF molecules introduced into the dorsal aorta 
      easily passed through the fenestrae of the capillary endothelial cell layer and the 
      thick fibrillar GBM, reaching the urinary space to be adsorbed to the visceral 
      epithelial cell surface or taken up by these visceral epithelial cells. On the other 
      hand, NF hardly passed through the capillary wall. These results show that the 
      nonosmoregulating mesonephric glomerulus of the brown hagfish has a working anionic 
      barrier system. The function of its glomerulus is compared to that of the mammalian 
      metanephric glomerulus.

      receptor binding.
PG  - 367-73
AB  - Bicuculline-sensitive [3H]GABA receptor binding was studied in membrane fractions 
      prepared from vertebrate whole brain or invertebrate cephalic ganglia. In tissue not 
      treated with Triton X-100, a significant amount of bicuculline-displaceable [3H]GABA 
      binding was detected in the brains of all vertebrates studied, with the hagfish 
      brain binding over twice as much [3H]GABA as the spiny dogfish, the next oldest 
      species. All other vertebrates bound similar amounts of [3H]GABA, being one-third to 
      one-fourth that observed in the hagfish. In contrast, after Triton treatment, the 
      hagfish displayed the least amount of bicuculline-sensitive [3H]GABA binding and, 
      under those conditions, the amount of binding observed increased in an evolutionary 
      fashion. No measurable bicuculline-sensitive GABA receptor binding was noted in any 
      invertebrate studied. These results suggest that bicuculline-sensitive GABA 
      receptors are present in the brains of all vertebrates and that during the course of 
      evolution there developed a Triton-sensitive substance(s) whose presence modifies 
      the kinetic properties of this receptor site.

AB  - The isozyme patterns of lactate dehydrogenases of various tissues were studied on 51 
      hagfish by starch-gel electrophoresis. Nine lactate dehydrogenase phenotypes were 
      encountered, suggesting the coexistence of two alleles at each of the two separate 
      gene loci. There apparently was no interaction between the products of these two 
      separate loci. Even the products of two alleles at the same locus were apparently 
      incapable of forming hybrid molecules, an indication of the possible monomeric 
      nature of each lactate dehydrogenase molecule.

TI  - Comparison of antimicrobial activity in the epidermal mucus extracts of fish.
PG  - 85-92
LID - 10.1016/j.cbpb.2008.01.011 [doi]
AB  - The mucus layer on the surface of fish consists of several antimicrobial agents that 
      provide a first line of defense against invading pathogens. To date, little is known 
      about the antimicrobial properties of the mucus of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), 
      brook trout (S. fontinalis), koi carp (Cyprinus carpio sub sp. koi), striped bass 
      (Morone saxatilis), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and hagfish (Myxine 
      glutinosa). The epidermal mucus samples from these fish were extracted with acidic, 
      organic and aqueous solvents to identify potential antimicrobial agents including 
      basic peptides, secondary metabolites, aqueous and acid soluble compounds. Initial 
      screening of the mucus extracts against a susceptible strain of Salmonella enterica 
      C610, showed a significant variation in antimicrobial activity among the fish 
      species examined. The acidic mucus extracts of brook trout, haddock and hagfish 
      exhibited bactericidal activity. The organic mucus extracts of brook trout, striped 
      bass and koi carp showed bacteriostatic activity. There was no detectable activity 
      in the aqueous mucus extracts. Further investigations of the activity of the acidic 
      mucus extracts of brook trout, haddock and hagfish showed that these fish species 
      had specific activity for fish and human pathogens, demonstrating the role of fish 
      mucus in antimicrobial protection. In comparison to brook trout and haddock, the 
      minimum bactericidal concentrations of hagfish acidic mucus extracts were found to 
      be approximately 1.5 to 3.0 times lower against fish pathogens and approximately 1.6 
      to 6.6 folds lower for human pathogens. This preliminary information suggests that 
      the mucus from these fish species may be a source of novel antimicrobial agents for 
      fish and human health related applications.

TI  - Prosomatostatin-I is processed to somatostatin-26 and somatostatin-14 in the 
      pancreas of the bowfin, Amia calva.
PG  - 33-9
AB  - With the exception of the Agnatha (lampreys and hagfishes), somatostatin-14 is the 
      predominant molecular form of somatostatin in the pancreas of species from all 
      classes of vertebrates yet studied. The pancreas of the holostean fish, Amia calva 
      (bowfin; order Amiiformes) contained somatostatin-like immunoreactivity that was 
      resolved by reversed phase HPLC in two components. The primary structure of the more 
      abundant peptide (somatostatin-26) was established as: 
      Ser-Ala-Asn-Pro-Ala5-Leu-Ala-Pro-Arg-Glu10-Arg-Lys-Ala-Gly-+ ++Cys15-Lys-Asn-Phe- 
      Phe-Trp20-Lys-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser25-Cys. This amino acid sequence shows one substitution 
      (Leu for Met at position 6) and two deletions compared with mammalian 
      somatostatin-28. The minor component was identical to somatostatin-14. The data show 
      that the pathway of post-translational processing of prosomatostatin-I in the bowfin 
      pancreas is appreciably different from the corresponding pathway in teleost fish and 
      higher vertebrates.

AB  - Four specimens of the five-gilled white mid-dorsal line hagfish, Eptatretus 
      wandoensis sp. nov. were recently collected from the southwestern Sea of Korea 
      (Wando). This new species has five pairs of gill apertures, 14-18 prebranchial slime 
      pores, 4 branchial slime pores, a dark brown back with a white mid-dorsal line and a 
      white belly. These hagfish are similar to Eptatretus burgeri and Eptatretus minor in 
      having a white mid-dorsal line, but can be readily distinguished by the numbers of 
      gill apertures (5 vs. 6-7), gill pouches (5 vs. 6), and prebranchial slime pores 
      (14-18 vs. > 18), as well as the body color (dark brown back vs. gray or brown 
      pale). In terms of genetic differences, Eptatretus wandoensis could be clearly 
      distinguished from E. burgeri (0.9% in 16S rRNA and 8.5% in cytochrome c oxidase 
      subunit I sequences) and E. minor (4.5% and 13.9%).

TI  - Carbohydrate metabolism and hepatic zonation in the Atlantic hagfish, Myxine 
      glutinosa liver: effects of hormones.
PG  - 211-9
LID - 10.1007/BF00004369 [doi]
AB  - Viable Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) hepatocytes were isolated from combined 
      or separated large and small lobes and carbohydrate metabolism was studied. Cells 
      had low levels of glycogen (16-30 μmol·g(-1)), and low rates of total glucose 
      production (TGP; 0-480 nmol·h(-1)·g(-1) cells). Lactate flux to glucose (5.5 
      nmol·h(-1)·g(-1)) and CO2 (76 nmol·h(-1)·g(-1)) was lower than reported values for 
      teleosts, with a low percentage (30%) of the lactate carbon reaching glucose. 
      Insulin significantly increased total glucose production and gluconeogenesis and 
      decreased 6-phosphofructo 1-kinase (PFK-1) activities and glucose oxidation, while 
      glucagon was without effect on any parameter studied. Forskolin significantly 
      increased TGP. Epinephrine (Epi), norepinephrine (NEpi), isoproterenol (Iso), and 
      phenylephrine (Phe) all decreased CO2 production from lactate; propanolol blocked 
      the effects of Epi, NEpi, and Iso. The large lobe, accounting for 65% of total liver 
      mass, had a higher glycogen content and higher CO2 production from lactate compared 
      to the small lobe. Furthermore, enzyme activities in the large lobe were greater 
      than in the small lobe, with the exception of glycogen phosphorylase (GPase) which 
      exhibited smaller %a values in the large lobe. These data indicate the presence of a 
      hormonally-responsive carbohydrate metabolism in hagfish hepatocytes, which is 
      qualitatively and quantitatively different between the two liver lobes.

TI  - Circadian Rhythms in Locomotor Activity of the Hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri VI. The 
      Effects of Cutting the Spinal Cord.
PG  - 329-33
LID - 10.2108/jsz.17.329 [doi]
AB  - The present study is designed to clarify the mechanism by which the circadian 
      pacemaker controls the locomotor activity of the hagfish and also to estimate the 
      role of brain and spinal cord in the swimming behavior of the animal. We examined 
      the effect of cutting the spinal cord at the 6 different positions on the circadian 
      rhythm and the locomotor behavior of the animal. The most frontal cut was located 
      between the brain and spinal cord, and the other 5 cuts were given to every 1/6 the 
      length of the spinal cord. The relation between the locomotor activity and the cut 
      position of spinal cord was summarized as follows. (1) When the ratio of frontal 
      part before the cut was 0/6-1/6, the animal locomoted under initiative of caudal 
      part, in random direction at the bottom and showed neither nocturnal rhythm in LD 
      nor circadian rhythm in DD. (2) When the ratio of the frontal part before the cut 
      was 4/6-5/6, the animal swam up to the surface under initiative of frontal part, and 
      showed both nocturnal rhythm in LD and circadian rhythm in DD. (3) When the frontal 
      ratio of spinal cord was 2/6 or 3/6, the animal showed both kinds of swimming 
      behavior of (1) and (2). These results suggest that the descending system from the 
      brain enable the hagfish to swim up to the surface and to express the rhythmicity of 
      locomotor activity under control of the circadian pacemaker when at least frontal 
      2/6 of the spinal cord is connected to the brain by neuronal networks not by humoral 
      factors.

PG  - 499-512
AB  - Biogenic peptides and amines associated with the chromaffin tissue in Atlantic cod 
      (Gadus morhua), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), European eel (Anguilla 
      anguilla), spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) and Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) 
      were identified utilizing immunohistochemical techniques. Within the posterior 
      cardinal vein (PCV) in cod, trout and eel, a subpopulation of chromaffin cells 
      displayed immunoreactivity to tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and 
      dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (D beta H) but not to 
      phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT). TH-like immunoreactivity was observed 
      within cells in hagfish hearts. Nerve fibres displaying vasoactive intestinal 
      peptide (VIP) immunoreactivity and pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating peptide 
      (PACAP) immunoreactivity innervated cod, trout and eel chromaffin cells. In eel, 
      neuropeptide Y (NPY)-like and peptide YY (PYY)-like immunoreactivity was located 
      within cells in the PCV, including chromaffin cells. Serotonin-like immunoreactivity 
      was observed within eel and cod chromaffin cells and in hagfish hearts. In the 
      dogfish axillary bodies, nerves displaying TH-like, VIP-like, PACAP-like, substance 
      P-like and galanin-like immunoreactivity were observed. These results are compared 
      with those of other vertebrates, and potential roles for these substances in the 
      control of catecholamine release are suggested.

TI  - A primitive placoderm sheds light on the origin of the jawed vertebrate face.
PG  - 500-3
LID - 10.1038/nature12980 [doi]
AB  - Extant vertebrates form two clades, the jawless Cyclostomata (lampreys and 
      hagfishes) and the jawed Gnathostomata (all other vertebrates), with contrasting 
      facial architectures. These arise during development from just a few key differences 
      in the growth patterns of the cranial primordia: notably, the nasal sacs and 
      hypophysis originate from a single placode in cyclostomes but from separate placodes 
      in gnathostomes, and infraoptic ectomesenchyme migrates forward either side of the 
      single placode in cyclostomes but between the placodes in gnathostomes. Fossil stem 
      gnathostomes preserve cranial anatomies rich in landmarks that provide proxies for 
      developmental processes and allow the transition from jawless to jawed vertebrates 
      to be broken down into evolutionary steps. Here we use propagation phase contrast 
      synchrotron microtomography to image the cranial anatomy of the primitive placoderm 
      (jawed stem gnathostome) Romundina, and show that it combines jawed vertebrate 
      architecture with cranial and cerebral proportions resembling those of cyclostomes 
      and the galeaspid (jawless stem gnathostome) Shuyu. This combination seems to be 
      primitive for jawed vertebrates, and suggests a decoupling between ectomesenchymal 
      growth trajectory, ectomesenchymal proliferation, and cerebral shape change during 
      the origin of gnathostomes.

PG  - 188-200
AB  - The histochemical distribution of peroxidase was studied in amphioxus, ammocoetes 
      larvae, adult lampreys, and hagfish. The endostyle of amphioxus displayed peroxidase 
      activity in zone 5 and, in some individuals, in zone 1 as well. The endostyle of 
      ammocoetes exhibited strong peroxidase activity in type 2c and type 3 cells. These 
      peroxidase-positive regions coincide well with radioiodine-binding regions 
      previously described. Thyroid follicles of adult lampreys stained strongly for 
      peroxidase, but those of the hagfish did not. The branchial sac of amphioxus showed 
      peroxidase activity, but the gill sac of cyclostomes did not. The intestine did not 
      show peroxidase activity in amphioxus or in cyclostomes.

TI  - Calcitonin-like substance in the plasma of Cyclostomata and its putative role.
PG  - 319-26
AB  - The present study indicated that in the lamprey, Lampetra japonica, which undergoes 
      a spawning migration from seawater to freshwater in its life cycle, a calcitonin 
      (CT)-like substance was not detected in the plasma of seawater-adapted specimens 
      (both sexes), but it was detected in the plasma of freshwater-adapted specimens 
      (both sexes) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using anti-salmon CT serum. 
      Furthermore, this substance increased with the gonad somatic index (GSI) in both 
      sexes. In lamprey, therefore, this CT-like substance may have some relationship with 
      gonadal maturation. In the plasma of the hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri, on the other 
      hand, the CT-like substance was always extremely high (47.2+/-4.2 ng/ml) 
      independently of GSI in both sexes. However, a correlation was found between this 
      substance and plasma calcium. In hagfish, the CT-like substance may participate in 
      calcium homeostasis, as does calcium excretion via bile, because the hagfish has the 
      highest bile calcium concentration determined to date among vertebrates, with a 
      level corresponding to 12-fold that in plasma. This speculation is supported by 
      reports that, in rat and cartilaginous fish, CT acts on calcium excretion via bile. 
      In both fishes, moreover, the molecular weight of these substances was equal to that 
      of salmon CT, which strongly suggests that these substances detected here are their 
      CTs.

AB  - The vertebrate cerebellum arises at the dorsal part of rhombomere 1, induced by 
      signals from the isthmic organizer. Two major cerebellar neuronal subtypes, granule 
      cells (excitatory) and Purkinje cells (inhibitory), are generated from the anterior 
      rhombic lip and the ventricular zone, respectively. This regionalization and the way 
      it develops are shared in all extant jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes). However, very 
      little is known about early evolution of the cerebellum. The lamprey, an extant 
      jawless vertebrate lineage or cyclostome, possesses an undifferentiated, plate-like 
      cerebellum, whereas the hagfish, another cyclostome lineage, is thought to lack a 
      cerebellum proper. In this study, we found that hagfish Atoh1 and Wnt1 genes are 
      co-expressed in the rhombic lip, and Ptf1a is expressed ventrally to them, 
      confirming the existence of r1's rhombic lip and the ventricular zone in 
      cyclostomes. In later stages, lamprey Atoh1 is downregulated in the posterior r1, in 
      which the NeuroD increases, similar to the differentiation process of cerebellar 
      granule cells in gnathostomes. Also, a continuous Atoh1-positive domain in the 
      rostral r1 is reminiscent of the primordium of valvula cerebelli of ray-finned 
      fishes. Lastly, we detected a GAD-positive domain adjacent to the Ptf1a-positive 
      ventricular zone in lampreys, suggesting that the Ptf1a-positive cells differentiate 
      into some GABAergic inhibitory neurons such as Purkinje and other inhibitory neurons 
      like in gnathostomes. Altogether, we conclude that the ancestral genetic programs 
      for the formation of a distinct cerebellum were established in the last common 
      ancestor of vertebrates.

AB  - Hagfish are an excellent model species in which to draw inferences on the evolution 
      of transport systems in early-vertebrates owing to their basal position in 
      vertebrate phylogeny. Glucose is a ubiquitous cellular energy source that is 
      transported into cells via two classes of carrier proteins: sodium-glucose linked 
      transporters (Sglt; Slc5a) and glucose transporters (Glut; Slc2a). While previous 
      pharmacological evidence has suggested the presence of both sodium-dependent and 
      -independent transport mechanisms in the hagfish, the molecular identities were 
      heretofore unconfirmed. We have identified and phylogenetically characterized both a 
      Slc5a1-like and Slc2a-like gene in the Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii); the 
      latter sharing common ancestry with other glucose-transporting isoforms of the Slc2a 
      family. To assess the potential post-prandial regulation of these glucose 
      transporters, we examined the abundance and localization of these transporters with 
      qPCR and immunohistochemistry alongside functional studies using radiolabeled 
      (14)C-(D)-glucose. The effects of glucose- or insulin-injection on glucose transport 
      rate and transporter expression were also examined to determine their potential 
      role(s) in the regulation of intestinal glucose carrier proteins. Feeding prompted 
      an increase in glucose uptake across the hindgut at both 0.5 mM (~84%) and 1 mM 
      (~183%) concentrations. Concomitant increases were observed in hindgut Slc5a1 
      protein expression. These effects were not observed following either of glucose- or 
      insulin-injection, indicating these post-prandial factors are not the driving force 
      for transporter regulation over this timeframe. We conclude that Pacific hagfish 
      utilize evolutionarily-conserved mechanisms of glucose uptake and so represent a 
      useful model to understand early vertebrate evolution of glucose uptake and 
      regulation.

TI  - Median eminence equivalence of the neurohypophysis of the hagfish, Eptatretus 
      burgeri.
PG  - 348-54
AB  - Three substances of different molecular size were injected into the ventricular 
      space (III) of the neurohypophysis of anesthetized hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri, to 
      learn whether such substances could diffuse across the connective tissue barrier 
      between the neuro- and adenohypophysis. The substances tested were trypan blue, a 
      vital dye that is a fine particulate colloid; horseradish peroxidase (HRP), an 
      enzyme protein whose distribution in tissue can be revealed through its chromogenic 
      action on a substrate; and ferric ion, whose distribution can be revealed through 
      the Prussian blue reaction. All three substances were transferred across the 
      neurohypophyseal wall to the extracerebral area within a few minutes, the trypan 
      blue and HRP apparently through action by tanycytes. The trypan blue, within a 
      15-min period, moved no further. The HRP protein diffused through connective tissue 
      as far as the dorsal (2 min) and ventral (5 min) borders of the adenohypophysis, but 
      did not enter the secretory cells themselves. The ferric ion reached the 
      adenohypophysis quickly (2 min) and entered the secretory cells in higher 
      concentration than it was in the surrounding connective tissue. These data indicate 
      that the hagfish ventral neurohypophysis is functionally capable of supplying 
      neurosecretory regulatory factors to the adenohypophysis. It is thus a "diffusional 
      median eminence." We can propose that the cyclostome median eminence, lacking a 
      portal relation to the adenohypophysis, represents the phylogenetically primitive 
      brain--pituitary relationship.

TI  - The structure and physical properties of invertebrate and primitive vertebrate 
      arteries.
PG  - 2185-96
AB  - Light and electron microscopy and in vitro inflation experiments were conducted on 
      the aortae of three different invertebrate species: the lobster Homarus americanus, 
      the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus and the whelk Busycon contrarium. Inflation 
      experiments were also performed on the aortae of two species of primitive 
      vertebrates, the sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus and the Atlantic hagfish Myxine 
      glutinosa. The inflation experiments demonstrated similar overall biomechanical 
      properties in each case, despite the existence of differences in tissue structure. 
      The vessels were compliant at low strains, but demonstrated nonlinear elasticity, 
      increasing in stiffness as strains increased; this property could act as protection 
      against artery wall rupture. The vessels of the lamprey, hagfish and lobster are 
      capable of acting as fairly efficient elastic reservoirs and of smoothing blood flow 
      during circulation as they had low hysteresis values (13-18%). The aortae of the 
      horseshoe crab and whelk, if performing this function, have much higher energy 
      losses, up to more than 30% per cycle. The microscopy studies of the aortae of the 
      lobster, horseshoe crab and whelk revealed tissue structures which differ widely 
      from each other as well as from the structures of the lamprey and hagfish. None of 
      these arteries contained elastin, but all contained fibrillar material which 
      differed in appearance, size and arrangement between species. These materials were 
      conjectured to contribute to the elastic properties of the tissue.

      3beta,26(27)-dihydroxy-5beta-cholestane. 3. 16-Deoxymyxinol, the third known bile 
      alcohol having the 3beta-hydroxy-5alpha-hydrogen configuration, poses again the 
      question of how the 3beta-hydroxyl group of cholesterol can be ;retained' in 
      biosynthesis of primitive bile salts.

      studied after ultrarapid cryofixation and freeze substitution in diverse media 
      (osmium tetroxide in acetone; several aqueous glutaraldehyde-based media with or 
      without osmium). Only freeze substitution with osmium tetroxide-acetone preserved 
      the granules intact, allowing visualization of its single unit membrane. Tests of 
      the rupture or stability of freshly secreted mucous granules in sea water and other 
      aqueous media showed the membranes of the granules are permeable to all inorganic 
      cations tested, ranging in relative mass from ammonium to barium. They are permeable 
      to the univalent anions chloride, nitrate, and bicarbonate, but not to the di- or 
      trivalent anions sulfate, phosphate, and citrate. Moreover, in solutions where 
      nonpenetrant anions were present, rupture occurred if the osmotic pressure was below 
      a critical level (about 800 mOsmol/l). The structural and permeability 
      characteristics of the granules account for the explosive speed with which they 
      rupture, releasing their mucous contents, on contact with sea water.

TI  - [Cloning and expression of VLRB of Lampetra japonica and generation of the 
      corresponding monoclonal antibodies].
PG  - 465-71
AB  - The agnathans (lampreys and hagfishes) are representatives of the jawless 
      vertebrates. The receptor molecules of adaptive immune system in lampreys are 
      different from the antigen receptors in mammal vertebrates. The unique receptor 
      molecules of lampreys are known as variable lymphocyte receptors (VLR). There are 
      three types of VLRs in lampreys, VLRA, VLRB, and VLRC. Multimeric antigen-specific 
      VLRB antibodies are secreted by VLRB+ lymphocytes and constitute the major 
      components of the humoral arm of the lamprey adaptive immune system. Oligomeric VLRB 
      antibodies are composed of four or five disulfide-linked dimeric subunits, which are 
      similar to IgM antibodies in structure and function. In this study, the conservative 
      c-terminal of Lampetra japonica VLRB was cloned and expressed in BL21 E. coli. The 
      recombinant VLRB protein was purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography column. After 
      Balb/c mice immunity, cell fusion, the positive clones were screened by indirect 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Finally, the hybridoma cells that 
      produced specific anti-VLRB monoclonal antibodies were obtained. In order to get a 
      large number of antibodies against VLRB, the hybridoma cells were injected into the 
      abdominal cavity of Balb/c mice and the antibodies were purified by protein G 
      sepharose. The results of ELISA indicated that the valence of anti-VLRB antibodies 
      was 1:40000. Western blotting assay showed that the antibodies were able to detect 
      both recombinant VLRB and secreted VLRB in lamprey sera. Flow cytometry analysis 
      also revealed the existence of VLRB on the surface of lymphocytes. In summary, the 
      anti-VLRB monoclonal antibodies provided a major tool for studying lamprey adaptive 
      immune system.

AB  - The maximum power output of isolated perfused ventricles of the hafish (Eptatretus 
      cirrhatus) averaged 0.367±0.031 mW g(-1) (n=9), considerably high than estimates for 
      the heart of the Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa). Maximal minute volumes 
      averaged 21.55±1.28 ml min(-1)kg(-1), with a mean stroke volume of 0.71±0.14 ml 
      kg(-1) body weight, values which are similar to those reported for many teleost and 
      elasmobranch hearts.Ventricular output showed the characteristic dependence upon 
      atrial filling pressure up to an optimum filling pressure ofc. 4 mm Hg. At output 
      pressures exceeding 14 mm Hg the stroke volume and power output fell sharply. At 
      these afterloads, the ventral aorta remained distended following semilunar valve 
      closure and so the volume of fluid ejected on ventricular systole was reduced. There 
      was little change in the frequency of the heart as either input or output pressures 
      were varied.

TI  - Mu opioid receptor-like sequences are present throughout vertebrate evolution.
PG  - 179-84
AB  - The sequence of the mu opioid receptor is highly conserved among human, rat, and 
      mouse. In order to gain insights into the evolution of the mu opioid receptor, 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to screen genomic DNA from a number of 
      different species using degenerate oligonucleotides which recognize a highly 
      conserved region. DNA was assayed from representative species of both the protostome 
      and deuterostome branches of the metazoan phylogenetic tree. Mu opioid receptor-like 
      sequences were found in all vertebrate species that were analyzed. These species 
      included bovine, chicken, bullfrog, striped bass, thresher shark, and Pacific 
      hagfish. However, no mu opioid receptor-like sequences were detected from 
      protostomes or from any invertebrates. The PCR results demonstrate that the region 
      of the mu opioid receptor gene between the first intracellular loop and the third 
      transmembrane domain (TM3) has been highly conserved during evolution and that mu 
      opioid receptor-like sequences are present in the earliest stages of vertebrate 
      evolution. Additional opioid receptor-like sequence was obtained from mRNA isolated 
      from Pacific hagfish brain using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The 
      sequence of the Pacific hagfish was most homologous with the human mu opioid 
      receptor (72% at the amino acid level between intracellular loop 1 and transmembrane 
      domain 6) although over the same region high homology was also observed with the 
      delta opioid receptor (69%), the kappa receptor (63%), and opioid receptor-like 
      (ORL1) (59%). The hagfish sequence showed low conservation with the mammalian opioid 
      receptors in the first and second extracellular loops but high conservation in the 
      transmembrane and intracellular domains.

TI  - Unresolved orthology and peculiar coding sequence properties of lamprey genes: the 
      KCNA gene family as test case.
PG  - 325
LID - 10.1186/1471-2164-12-325 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In understanding the evolutionary process of vertebrates, cyclostomes 
      (hagfishes and lamprey) occupy crucial positions. Resolving molecular phylogenetic 
      relationships of cyclostome genes with gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates) genes is 
      indispensable in deciphering both the species tree and gene trees. However, 
      molecular phylogenetic analyses, especially those including lamprey genes, have 
      produced highly discordant results between gene families. To efficiently scrutinize 
      this problem using partial genome assemblies of early vertebrates, we focused on the 
      potassium voltage-gated channel, shaker-related (KCNA) family, whose members are 
      mostly single-exon. RESULTS: Seven sea lamprey KCNA genes as well as six elephant 
      shark genes were identified, and their orthologies to bony vertebrate subgroups were 
      assessed. In contrast to robustly supported orthology of the elephant shark genes to 
      gnathostome subgroups, clear orthology of any sea lamprey gene could not be 
      established. Notably, sea lamprey KCNA sequences displayed unique codon usage 
      pattern and amino acid composition, probably associated with exceptionally high 
      GC-content in their coding regions. This lamprey-specific property of coding 
      sequences was also observed generally for genes outside this gene family. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that secondary modifications of sequence properties 
      unique to the lamprey lineage may be one of the factors preventing robust orthology 
      assessments of lamprey genes, which deserves further genome-wide validation. The 
      lamprey lineage-specific alteration of protein-coding sequence properties needs to 
      be taken into consideration in tackling the key questions about early vertebrate 
      evolution.

TI  - Identification of two Ikaros-like transcription factors in lamprey.
PG  - 162-70
AB  - The jawless Agnatha (lampreys and hagfishes) represent the phylogenetically oldest 
      order of vertebrates that are believed to lack the adaptive immune system of jawed 
      vertebrates. In order to search for molecular markers specific for cellular 
      components of the adaptive immune system in lampreys, we used the polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) to identify genes for transcription factors of the Ikaros family in 
      genomic DNA and cDNA libraries from two species of lampreys, Petromyzon marinus and 
      Lampetra fluviatilis. The mammalian Ikaros-like family of transcription factors 
      consists of five members, Ikaros, Helios, Aiolos, Eos and Pegasus, of which the 
      first three appear to be essential for lymphocyte development. Two different 
      Ikaros-like genes, named IKLF1 and IKLF2, were identified in lamprey. They both have 
      the conserved exon-intron structure of seven exons and show alternative splicing 
      like their counterparts in jawed vertebrates. The genes code for predicted proteins 
      of 589 and 513 amino acid residues, respectively. The proteins contain six highly 
      conserved zinc finger motifs that are 83-91% identical to the mammalian members of 
      the Ikaros-like family. The remaining parts of the sequences are, however, mostly 
      unalignable. Phylogenetic analysis based on the alignable segments of the sequences 
      does not identify the orthologous gene in jawed vertebrates but rather shows 
      equidistance of the lamprey Ikaros-like factors to each other and to Ikaros, Helios, 
      Aiolos and Eos. Expression studies by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and in situ 
      hybridization (ISH), however, provide evidence for moderate expression in presumed 
      lymphoid tissues like the gut epithelium and for high levels of expression in the 
      gonads, especially in the ovary.

TI  - Neural calcitropic peptides: immunoreactive characterization in fish and 
      invertebrates.
PG  - 15-9
AB  - Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and stanniocalcin (STC) are primarily produced by the 
      parathyroid glands and corpuscles of Stannius in tetrapods and fish, respectively. 
      However, it is now known that both calcitropic peptides are also synthesized outside 
      of these specialized endocrine glands. The current study employed Western blot 
      analysis to characterize PTH and STC in neural tissues of high- (rats) and low- 
      (hagfish, dogfish, rockfish, trout and skate) vertebrates and invertebrates 
      (starfish, squid, cuttlefish, snails, prawns). Immunoreactive PTH-like peptides, 
      comparable in size to PTH 1-84, were readily detectable in brains of vertebrates 
      lacking (fish) and possessing (rat) parathyroid glands and in invertebrate (snail) 
      ganglia. Immunoreactive STC-like peptides of varying size were similarly detected in 
      brains of vertebrates lacking (rat) and possessing (fish) corpuscles of Stannius and 
      in invertebrate (snail, prawn) ganglia. STC and PTH may thus have evolved as 
      ancestral neuropeptides.

TI  - A comparative study on innate immune parameters in the epidermal mucus of various 
      fish species.
PG  - 256-63
AB  - Fish epidermal mucus and its components provide the first line of defense against 
      pathogens. Little is known about the role of epidermal mucus enzymes in the innate 
      immune system of fish species such as Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), brook trout 
      (S. fontinalis), koi carp(Cyprinus carpio), striped bass (Morone saxatilis), 
      haddock, (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and hagfish (Myxine 
      glutinosa). The epidermal mucus samples from these fish were analysed for the 
      specific activities of various hydrolytic enzymes including lysozyme, alkaline 
      phosphatase, cathepsin B and proteases and the enzyme levels were compared among the 
      fish species. Of all the species hagfish mucus showed a high activity for lysozyme 
      and proteases and koi carp mucus had the highest levels of alkaline phosphatase and 
      cathepsin B. A wide variation in enzyme activities was observed among the seven 
      species and also between species of same family such as Arctic char and brook trout 
      (salmonidae), haddock and cod (gadidae). Only lysozyme levels showed a marked 
      variation with salinity where seawater fish showed approximately two times higher 
      lysozyme activity than freshwater-reared fish species. Characterization of proteases 
      with specific inhibitors showed Arctic char, brook trout, haddock and cod having 
      higher levels of serine over metalloproteases whereas koi carp and striped bass had 
      higher levels of metalloproteases over serine proteases. In contrast, hagfish had 
      almost equal proportion of both serine and metalloproteases. This study demonstrates 
      variation in the level of hydrolytic enzymes in the epidermal mucus of fish. These 
      results provide preliminary information for a better understanding of the role of 
      epidermal mucus and its components in the fish innate immune system.

TI  - Anatomy of the lamprey ear: morphological evidence for occurrence of horizontal 
      semicircular ducts in the labyrinth of Petromyzon marinus.
PG  - 432-46
LID - 10.1111/joa.12159 [doi]
AB  - In jawed (gnathostome) vertebrates, the inner ears have three semicircular canals 
      arranged orthogonally in the three Cartesian planes: one horizontal (lateral) and 
      two vertical canals. They function as detectors for angular acceleration in their 
      respective planes. Living jawless craniates, cyclostomes (hagfish and lamprey) and 
      their fossil records seemingly lack a lateral horizontal canal. The jawless 
      vertebrate hagfish inner ear is described as a torus or doughnut, having one 
      vertical canal, and the jawless vertebrate lamprey having two. These observations on 
      the anatomy of the cyclostome (jawless vertebrate) inner ear have been unchallenged 
      for over a century, and the question of how these jawless vertebrates perceive 
      angular acceleration in the yaw (horizontal) planes has remained open. To provide an 
      answer to this open question we reevaluated the anatomy of the inner ear in the 
      lamprey, using stereoscopic dissection and scanning electron microscopy. The present 
      study reveals a novel observation: the lamprey has two horizontal semicircular ducts 
      in each labyrinth. Furthermore, the horizontal ducts in the lamprey, in contrast to 
      those of jawed vertebrates, are located on the medial surface in the labyrinth 
      rather than on the lateral surface. Our data on the lamprey horizontal duct suggest 
      that the appearance of the horizontal canal characteristic of gnathostomes (lateral) 
      and lampreys (medial) are mutually exclusive and indicate a parallel evolution of 
      both systems, one in cyclostomes and one in gnathostome ancestors.

TI  - Control of the systemic heart and the portal heart of Myxine glutinosa.
PG  - 1429-34
AB  - The effects of preload and afterload on the performance of the systemic heart of the 
      hagfish Myxine glutinosa were investigated before and during sotalol treatment using 
      an in situ perfusion technique. Elevation of input pressure (preload) increased flow 
      by means of increased stroke volume and heart rate in accordance with Starling's law 
      of the heart, while increased output pressure (afterload) decreased flow mainly 
      because of decreased stroke volume. Treatment with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist 
      sotalol did not change the quality of the responses to increased preload or 
      afterload, although power output decreased by 40 % and flow rate was reduced by 35 % 
      mainly due to a decrease in heart rate. Isolated preparations of the systemic heart 
      and the portal heart provided information on the chronotropic effects of different 
      agonists and antagonists. Both the systemic heart and the portal heart were 
      insensitive to adrenergic and cholinergic agonists, adrenocorticotropic hormone and 
      the cholinoceptor antagonist atropine. Sotalol treatment lowered the rate of 
      spontaneous contractions by 30 % in the systemic heart preparation and by 21 % in 
      the portal heart preparation. This study has given further evidence for the 
      existence of a tonic beta-adrenoceptor stimulation of the hagfish systemic heart and 
      portal heart, and demonstrated the importance of that stimulation in maintaining 
      systemic heart performance.

TI  - Sarcoplasmic calcium-binding proteins in protochordate and cyclostome muscle: 
      characterization of a new protein from amphioxus.
PG  - 85-93
AB  - A sarcoplasmic calcium-binding protein (SCP) has been purified from the muscle of 
      the protochordate Amphioxus and shown to be more similar to invertebrate SCP's than 
      to their counterpart found in vertebrates, i.e. parvalbumins. The Amphioxus protein 
      has a pI of 4.9, is rich in tyrosine and tryptophan, has a molecular weight of 
      22,000 and binds strongly 2Ca2+ with a pK of 7.88. Magnesium competes with calcium 
      for only one of the two metal-binding sites and induces positive cooperativity in 
      Ca2+ binding. In cyclostome muscle (lamprey and hagfish), no protein with high 
      affinity for Ca2+ or Mg2+ could be found, irrespective of molecular weight. Instead, 
      a protein with moderate affinity for Ca2+ (less than or equal to 10(5) M(-1)) was 
      detected: it has a molecular weight of 60,000 and might be quite ubiquitous, as the 
      presence of a similar protein has been reported both in red and white muscle of 
      vertebrates such as chicken and rabbit.

      deuterostome animals, several unresolved relationships remain. These include the 
      relationship between the three deuterostome phyla (chordates, echinoderms and 
      hemichordates), and the monophyletic or paraphyletic origin of the cyclostomes 
      (hagfish and lampreys). Using robust Bayesian statistical analysis of 18S ribosomal 
      DNA, mitochondrial genes and nuclear protein-coding DNA, we find strong support for 
      a hemichordate-echinoderm clade, and for monophyly of the cyclostomes.

TI  - Plasma levels of nitrite and nitrate in early and recent classes of fish.
PG  - 431-9
AB  - The stable metabolite of nitric oxide in plasma is NOx, the sum of nitrite plus 
      nitrate. Measures of plasma NOx may provide information about the nitric oxide tonus 
      of the entire endothelium including capillary microvessels. Although data are 
      available for mammalian species, plasma NOx measurements in early vertebrate species 
      are scarce. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that plasma NOx 
      would be similar to the NO in the water environment for fish in early classes 
      (Agnatha and Chondrichthye) and would exceed water NOx levels in the known 
      nitrite-sensitive fish (Osteichthye). Plasma samples were obtained from 18 species 
      of adult fish (n=167) and from their housing or natural water environment. NOx was 
      measured by using chemiluminescence. Plasma NO was detected in all species and 
      ranged from 0.5 nmol/ml (skate) to 453.9 nmol/ml (shortnose gar). Average plasma NOx 
      was significantly higher in sea lamprey than in Atlantic hagfish whereas that of 
      little skate was 3-fold lower than in spiny dogfish shark. Plasma NO differed 
      significantly among early bony fish (paddlefish, pallid sturgeon, gar) yet was 
      similar among modern bony fish, with the exception of rainbow trout. Plasma NOx 
      reflected water NO in only 2 species (hagfish and shark), and levels did not 
      coincide with nitrite sensitivity. This study provides an expanded comparative view 
      of plasma NO, levels across 3 groups of early fish. The data obtained suggest a 
      nitric oxide system in early and modern fish.

TI  - Hagfish slime gland thread cells. II. Isolation and characterization of intermediate 
      filament components associated with the thread.
PG  - 670-7
AB  - The slime glands of hagfish have two major cell types, gland thread cells (GTCs) and 
      gland mucous cells (GMCs), both of which upon contact with water contribute to the 
      formation of an abundant quantity of viscous mucus. In previous studies we reported 
      a method for the isolation of GTCs and showed that each ellipsoidal thread cell 
      normally contains a single tapered thread which is uniquely coiled into a 
      space-saving conformation and occupies most of the cell volume. Subsequently, the 
      developing thread was found to consist mainly of intermediate filaments (IFs) 
      aligned in parallel not only to one another but also to a far fewer number of 
      interspersed microtubules (see accompanying paper). In the present report, urea 
      extracts of GTCs were purified and characterized to establish the properties of 
      thread components. One major (alpha) and two minor (beta, gamma) components prepared 
      by anion exchange chromatography were shown to have similar apparent molecular 
      weights of 63,500 +/- 500 daltons but different isoelectric pH values (alpha, 7.56; 
      beta, 5.67; gamma, 5.31). Although the amino acid content of alpha differed 
      significantly from beta and gamma, each of the three was highest in Gly, relatively 
      high in Glx, Ser, Thr, Asx, Ala, Val, and Leu, and relatively low in Cys/2 and Trp. 
      The amino acid compositions of beta and gamma were very similar, and only beta 
      showed evidence of carbohydrate. The threonine content of the alpha component was 
      higher than has been reported for IFs of different origin, and the high content of 
      hydroxyamino acids (18, 19 residues per 100) in alpha, beta, and gamma has been 
      approached only by several IF polypeptides from human or bovine epidermal keratins. 
      Mixtures of the purified components formed 9-11-nm filaments in vitro. The results 
      indicate that the hagfish thread cell is a rich source of IFs, which have a 
      structure that facilitates formation of macrofibrils within the cell.

TI  - A serum factor that recalcifies demineralized bone is conserved in bony fish and 
      sharks but is not found in invertebrates.
PG  - 326-34
AB  - We investigated the evolutionary origin of a serum activity that induces 
      calcification within a type I collagen matrix, an activity previously described in 
      rat and bovine serum. Serum was obtained from vertebrates with calcified tissues 
      (bony fish and shark), vertebrates without calcified tissues (lamprey and hagfish), 
      and three invertebrates (marine worm, crab, and sea urchin). Serum from the bony 
      fish and shark proved to contain a potent nucleator of collagen calcification; like 
      the previously described calcifying activity in rat serum, the fish and shark 
      activities are both able to recalcify a demineralized rat tibia when tested in 
      Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing as little as 1.5% of the respective 
      serum and have an apparent molecular weight of 50-150 kDa. No calcifying activity 
      could be detected in any of several experimental tests of invertebrate or hagfish 
      serum. Weak calcifying activity could be detected in lamprey serum, but 
      calcification was restricted to the growth plate of the decalcified tibia, with no 
      detectable calcification in the type I collagen of the midshaft. These studies 
      reveal a correlation between the evolutionary timing of the appearance of calcified 
      tissues in vertebrates and the appearance of the serum activity that initiates 
      calcification within collagen and, therefore, support the hypothesis that this serum 
      activity may play a role in normal calcification of bone.

TI  - Effects of preload and afterload on the performance of the in situ perfused portal 
      heart of the New Zealand hagfish Eptatretus cirrhatus.
PG  - 401-5
AB  - The portal heart of the New Zealand hagfish (Eptatretus cirrhatus) was perfused in 
      situ. Stroke volume, cardiac output and power output increased in response to 
      increased preload, in accordance with Starling's law of the heart. A positive 
      chronotropic effect was found when the input pressure increased from 0.05 to 0.1 
      kPa. Increased afterload decreased stroke volume and cardiac output. Power output 
      peaked at an output pressure of 0.22 kPa, after which it decreased. There was no 
      change in heart rate in response to increased afterload. In unanaesthetized resting 
      animals, the pressure in the supraintestinal vein, which supplies the portal heart, 
      ranged from 0.025 to 0.07 kPa (mean 0.040&plusmn;0.005 kPa). The beta-adrenoceptor 
      antagonist sotalol did not affect the response to different input and output 
      pressures. Sotalol produced a significant decrease in heart rate and abolished the 
      pressure-sensitive increase in heart rate. Bolus injections of adrenaline produced a 
      transient increase in portal heart rate. The negative chronotropic response to 
      sotalol and the response to adrenaline indicate the presence of an endogenous 
      beta-adrenergic tonus on the portal heart.

TI  - Phylogenetic distribution of aromatase and other androgen-converting enzymes in the 
      central nervous system.
PG  - 2283-90
AB  - Metabolism of [3H]androstenedione was studied in brain tissue homogenates of 
      opossum, bird, snake, sea turtle, urodele amphibian, teleost, shark, skate, hagfish, 
      and lobster. Estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, or 17 alpha-estradiol was formed by central 
      neural tissues of all species, with the exception of the opossum, hagfish, and 
      lobster. Aromatase activity was concentrated in the forebrain, although some 
      estrogen was synthesized by mid- or hindbrain homogenates of two lower vertebrates 
      (teleost and skate) and the newly hatched chick. 5 alpha-Androstanedione (5 
      alpha-androstane-3,17-dione) or 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone were products of 
      metabolism in several nonmammalian vertebrates and in the invertebrate central 
      nervous system also. 5 alpha-Reductase was found in all major brain divisions. These 
      and previously reported comparative studies indicate that the ability to aromatize 
      and otherwise transform androgen substrates is a primitive characteristic of the 
      brain that has been widely conserved phylogenetically.

TI  - Evolutionary changes in lamin expression in the vertebrate lineage.
PG  - 392-403
LID - 10.1080/19491034.2017.1303592 [doi]
AB  - The nuclear lamina is involved in fundamental nuclear functions and provides 
      mechanical stability to the nucleus. Lamin filaments form a meshwork closely apposed 
      to the inner nuclear membrane and a small fraction of lamins exist in the nuclear 
      interior. Mutations in lamin genes cause severe hereditary diseases, the 
      laminopathies. During vertebrate evolution the lamin protein family has expanded. 
      While most vertebrate genomes contain 4 lamin genes, encoding the lamins A, B1, B2, 
      and LIII, the majority of non-vertebrate genomes harbor only a single lamin gene. We 
      have collected lamin gene and cDNA sequence information for representatives of the 
      major vertebrate lineages. With the help of RNA-seq data we have determined relative 
      lamin expression levels for representative tissues for species of 9 different 
      gnathostome lineages. Here we report that the level of lamin A expression is low in 
      cartilaginous fishes and ancient fishes and increases toward the mammals. Lamin B1 
      expression shows an inverse tendency to that of lamin A. Possible implications for 
      the change in the lamin A to B ratio is discussed in the light of its role in 
      nuclear mechanics.

AB  - Not long ago, urea was believed to freely diffuse across plasma membranes. The 
      discovery of specialized proteins to facilitate the movement of urea across the fish 
      gill, similar to those found in mammalian kidney, was exciting, and at the same 
      time, perplexing; especially considering the fact that, aside from elasmobranchs, 
      most fish do not produce urea as their primary nitrogenous waste. Increasingly, it 
      has become apparent that many fish do indeed produce at least a small amount of urea 
      through various processes and continued work on branchial urea transporters in 
      teleost and elasmobranch fishes has led to recent advances in the regulation of 
      these mechanisms. The following review outlines the substantial progress that has 
      been made towards understanding environmental and developmental impacts on fish gill 
      urea transport. This review also outlines the work that has been done regarding 
      endocrine and neural control of urea excretion, most of which has been collected 
      from only a handful of teleost fish. It is evident that more research is needed to 
      establish the endocrine and neural control of urea excretion in fish, including fish 
      representative of more ancient lineages (hagfish and lamprey), and elasmobranch 
      fish.

TI  - Tachykinins and intestinal motility in different fish groups.
PG  - 388-96
AB  - The presence and function of tachykinins were studied in the intestine of hagfish 
      (Myxine glutinosa), lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis), starry ray (Raja radiata), 
      lungfish (Lepidosiren paradoxa), bichir (Polypterus senegalensis), and rainbow trout 
      (Oncorhynchus mykiss), which represent different systematic groups of fish. 
      Immunohistochemistry revealed cells containing substance P (SP)-like material in the 
      intestine of lamprey and lungfish, and in the stomach of the ray. The intestinal 
      motility was studied using isolated muscle strip preparations. SP had no effect on 
      hagfish or lamprey intestine. In the other four species SP produced intestinal 
      contractions. In ray, bichir, and lungfish the tachykinins may be released from 
      endocrine cells and act, at least in the bichir and lungfish, directly onto the 
      smooth muscle cells. In the rainbow trout intestine, where SP-like material may be 
      released from both nerve fibres and endocrine cells, it is indicated that the 
      contractile effect is in part direct upon the smooth muscle and in part via 
      stimulation of cholinergic and serotonergic neurons.

AB  - Endothelin receptors are G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) of the β-group of 
      rhodopsin receptors that bind to endothelin ligands, which are 21 amino acid long 
      peptides derived from longer prepro-endothelin precursors. The most basal Ednr-like 
      GPCR is found outside vertebrates in the cephalochordate amphioxus, but endothelin 
      ligands are only present among vertebrates, including the lineages of jawless 
      vertebrates (lampreys and hagfishes), cartilaginous vertebrates (sharks, rays, and 
      chimaeras), and bony vertebrates (ray-finned fishes and lobe-finned vertebrates 
      including tetrapods). A bona fide endothelin system is thus a vertebrate-specific 
      innovation with important roles for regulating the cardiovascular system, renal and 
      pulmonary processes, as well as for the development of the vertebrate-specific 
      neural crest cell population and its derivatives. Expectedly, dysregulation of 
      endothelin receptors and the endothelin system leads to a multitude of human 
      diseases. Despite the importance of different types of endothelin receptors for 
      vertebrate development and physiology, current knowledge on endothelin 
      ligand-receptor interactions, on the expression of endothelin receptors and their 
      ligands, and on the functional roles of the endothelin system for embryonic 
      development and in adult vertebrates is very much biased towards amniote 
      vertebrates. Recent analyses from a variety of vertebrate lineages, however, have 
      shown that the endothelin system in lineages such as teleost fish and lampreys is 
      more diverse and is divergent from the mammalian endothelin system. This diversity 
      is mainly based on differential evolution of numerous endothelin system components 
      among vertebrate lineages generated by two rounds of whole genome duplication (three 
      in teleosts) during vertebrate evolution. Here we review current understanding of 
      the evolutionary history of the endothelin receptor family in vertebrates 
      supplemented with surveys on the endothelin receptor gene complement of newly 
      available genome assemblies from phylogenetically informative taxa. Our assessment 
      further highlights the diversity of the vertebrate endothelin system and calls for 
      detailed functional and pharmacological analyses of the endothelin system beyond 
      tetrapods.

AB  - The agnathans (lampreys and hagfishes) are representatives of the jawless fishes and 
      constitute the first lineage of extant vertebrates to evolve within chordate 
      phylogenetic history. Previously, we showed that the southern hemisphere pouched 
      lamprey Geotria australis has the potential for pentachromacy with the expression of 
      five visual pigment (opsin) genes (LWS, SWS1, SWS2, RhA, and RhB) in five different 
      cone-like photoreceptors for life in a brightly lit environment exposed to a broad 
      spectrum of light. In contrast, the northern hemisphere sea lamprey Petromyzon 
      marinus dwells in a wide range of depths that are relatively deeper than the 
      epipelagic waters inhabited by G. australis. Thus, the light levels of the habitat 
      in which the sea lamprey resides are greatly diminished and different regions of the 
      light spectrum are differentially absorbed. Therefore, the visual systems of these 
      two species of lamprey constitute a natural experiment in which to study the 
      selection pressures underlying opsin gene expression and the evolution of color 
      discrimination. By analyzing the opsin genes of P. marinus, we show the expression 
      of two intact retinal opsins, RhA and LWS, which, when regenerated with 11-cis 
      retinal, give peak spectral sensitivities (lambda(max) values) of 501 and 536 nm, 
      respectively. In contrast to G. australis, the genome of P. marinus possesses 
      remnants of SWS1 and SWS2 pseudogenes, which with the loss of RhB, suggests that P. 
      marinus is a dichromat. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we show that a single amino 
      acid substitution (Ser to Pro) at site 164 is responsible for a blue shift of 19 nm 
      of the LWS visual pigment of P. marinus compared with G. australis, which may 
      reflect habitat differences between the two species. Based on these studies, we 
      propose that gene loss (or duplication) and subsequent mutation plays an important 
      role in the evolution of color vision and that the complement and tuning of these 
      visual pigments reflect the ecology and light environment of these phylogenetically 
      basal vertebrates.

TI  - Evolution of the immune system in the lower vertebrates.
PG  - 127-49
LID - 10.1146/annurev-genom-090711-163747 [doi]
AB  - The evolutionary emergence of vertebrates was accompanied by the invention of 
      adaptive immunity. This is characterized by extraordinarily diverse repertoires of 
      somatically assembled antigen receptors and the facility of antigen-specific memory, 
      leading to more rapid and efficient secondary immune responses. Adaptive immunity 
      emerged twice during early vertebrate evolution, once in the lineage leading to 
      jawless fishes (such as lamprey and hagfish) and, independently, in the lineage 
      leading to jawed vertebrates (comprising the overwhelming majority of extant 
      vertebrates, from cartilaginous fishes to mammals). Recent findings on the immune 
      systems of jawless and jawed fishes (here referred to as lower vertebrates) impact 
      on the identification of general principles governing the structure and function of 
      adaptive immunity and its coevolution with innate defenses. The discovery of 
      conserved features of adaptive immunity will guide attempts to generate synthetic 
      immunological functionalities and thus provide new avenues for intervening with 
      faulty immune functions in humans.

TI  - Metaphylogeny of 82 gene families sheds a new light on chordate evolution.
PG  - 32-7
AB  - Achieving a better comprehension of the evolution of species has always been an 
      important matter for evolutionary biologists. The deuterostome phylogeny has been 
      described for many years, and three phyla are distinguishable: Echinodermata 
      (including sea stars, sea urchins, etc...), Hemichordata (including acorn worms and 
      pterobranchs), and Chordata (including urochordates, cephalochordates and extant 
      vertebrates). Inside the Chordata phylum, the position of vertebrate species is 
      quite unanimously accepted. Nonetheless, the position of urochordates in regard with 
      vertebrates is still the subject of debate, and has even been suggested by some 
      authors to be a separate phylum from cephalochordates and vertebrates. It was also 
      the case for agnathans species -myxines and hagfish- for which phylogenetic evidence 
      was recently given for a controversial monophyly. This raises the following 
      question: which one of the cephalochordata or urochordata is the sister group of 
      vertebrates and what are their relationships? In the present work, we analyzed 82 
      protein families presenting homologs between urochordata and other deuterostomes and 
      focused on two points: 1) testing accurately the position of urochordata and 
      cephalochordata phyla in regard with vertebrates as well as chordates monophyly, 2) 
      performing an estimation of the rate of gene loss in the Ciona intestinalis genome. 
      We showed that the urochordate phyla is the vertebrate sister group and that gene 
      loss played a major role in structuring the urochordate genome.

TI  - The expression of FoxG1 in the early development of the European river lamprey

      vertebrates.

AB  - FoxG1, a member of the Fox/Forkhead family of winged helix transcription factors, 
      plays key roles in the induction and spatial compartmentalization of the 
      telencephalon in vertebrates. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments have 
      established FoxG1 as a maintenance factor for neural progenitors and a crucial 
      player in the specification of the ventral telencephalon (subpallium). For the first 
      time in evolution, the telencephalon appeared in the ancestors of vertebrates, 
      including cyclostomes. However, although FoxG1 homologues are present in cyclostomes 
      (i.e., in lampreys and hagfishes), no systematic study of the spatial-temporal 
      expression of FoxG1 during the embryonic development of these animals has been 
      carried out. Given these findings, we have now studied FoxG1 spatial-temporal 
      expression patterns in the early development of the European river lamprey Lampetra 
      fluviatilis. We show that in contrast to other vertebrates, in which the expression 
      of FoxG1 begins during neurulation, the expression of this gene in L. fluviatilis 
      starts after neurulation, first at stage 21 (early head protrusion) in the area of 
      the otic placodes and then, beginning from stage 22, in the telencephalon. Such 
      heterochrony of FoxG1 expression in the lamprey may reflect the fact that in this 
      basally divergent representative of vertebrates, telencephalon specification occurs 
      relatively late. This heterochrony could be related to the evolutionary history of 
      the telencephalon, with a recent appearance in vertebrates as an extension to more 
      ancient anterior brain regions. Another peculiarity of FoxG1 expression in lamprey, 
      compared to other vertebrates, is that it is not expressed in the lamprey optic 
      structures.

TI  - Lamprey-like gills in a gnathostome-related Devonian jawless vertebrate.
PG  - 1183-5
AB  - So far, the Palaeozoic fossil jawless vertebrates have not provided any direct 
      evidence for the organization of the gills, apart from vague impressions--supposedly 
      left by gill filaments--on the bony surface of the gill chamber in certain armoured 
      forms or 'ostracoderms' (for example, osteostracans and heterostracans). The latter 
      are currently regarded as more closely related to the living jawed vertebrates 
      (crown gnathostomes) than to the living jawless vertebrates (hagfish and lampreys, 
      or cyclostomes). Here we report the first direct evidence for the position of the 
      gill filaments--possibly supported by gill rays--enclosed by gill pouches in a 
      370-million year (Myr)-old jawless vertebrate, Endeiolepis, from the Late Devonian 
      fossil fish site of Miguasha, Quebec, Canada. This extinct jawless fish has much the 
      same gill organization as living lampreys, although it possesses an unusually large 
      number of gill pouches--a condition unlike that in any extant vertebrates and that 
      raises questions about gill development. Endeiolepis is currently regarded as a 
      close relative of anaspids, a group of 410-430-Myr-old 'ostracoderms'. Assuming that 
      current vertebrate phylogeny is correct, this discovery demonstrates that pouches 
      enclosing the gills are primitive for vertebrates, but have been subsequently lost 
      in jawed vertebrates.

TI  - Tunicates and not cephalochordates are the closest living relatives of vertebrates.
PG  - 965-8
AB  - Tunicates or urochordates (appendicularians, salps and sea squirts), 
      cephalochordates (lancelets) and vertebrates (including lamprey and hagfish) 
      constitute the three extant groups of chordate animals. Traditionally, 
      cephalochordates are considered as the closest living relatives of vertebrates, with 
      tunicates representing the earliest chordate lineage. This view is mainly justified 
      by overall morphological similarities and an apparently increased complexity in 
      cephalochordates and vertebrates relative to tunicates. Despite their critical 
      importance for understanding the origins of vertebrates, phylogenetic studies of 
      chordate relationships have provided equivocal results. Taking advantage of the 
      genome sequencing of the appendicularian Oikopleura dioica, we assembled a 
      phylogenomic data set of 146 nuclear genes (33,800 unambiguously aligned amino 
      acids) from 14 deuterostomes and 24 other slowly evolving species as an outgroup. 
      Here we show that phylogenetic analyses of this data set provide compelling evidence 
      that tunicates, and not cephalochordates, represent the closest living relatives of 
      vertebrates. Chordate monophyly remains uncertain because cephalochordates, albeit 
      with a non-significant statistical support, surprisingly grouped with echinoderms, a 
      hypothesis that needs to be tested with additional data. This new phylogenetic 
      scheme prompts a reappraisal of both morphological and palaeontological data and has 
      important implications for the interpretation of developmental and genomic studies 
      in which tunicates and cephalochordates are used as model animals.

TI  - New evidence on the anatomy and phylogeny of the earliest vertebrates.
PG  - 1865-9
AB  - We report the discovery of a new agnathan specimen from the Lower Cambrian 
      Chengjiang Lagerstätte of China and thereby provide new evidence on the myomeres 
      (V-shaped), the branchial apparatus (gill filaments and arches), the dorsal fin and 
      the gonads (24-26) of the earliest vertebrates. The new specimen and the 
      co-occurring Myllokunmingia fengjiaoa and Haikouichthys ercaicunensis represent a 
      single species, which is a primitive member of the crown group craniates 
      (vertebrates) and post-dates the origin of the myxinoids (hagfish). The origin of 
      the vertebrate clade is at least as old as Early Cambrian.

TI  - Evolutionary diversification of retinoic acid receptor ligand-binding pocket 
      structure by molecular tinkering.
PG  - 150484
LID - 10.1098/rsos.150484 [doi]
LID - 150484
AB  - Whole genome duplications (WGDs) have been classically associated with the origin of 
      evolutionary novelties and the so-called duplication-degeneration-complementation 
      model describes the possible fates of genes after duplication. However, how sequence 
      divergence effectively allows functional changes between gene duplicates is still 
      unclear. In the vertebrate lineage, two rounds of WGDs took place, giving rise to 
      paralogous gene copies observed for many gene families. For the retinoic acid 
      receptors (RARs), for example, which are members of the nuclear hormone receptor 
      (NR) superfamily, a unique ancestral gene has been duplicated resulting in three 
      vertebrate paralogues: RARα, RARβ and RARγ. It has previously been shown that this 
      single ancestral RAR was neofunctionalized to give rise to a larger substrate 
      specificity range in the RARs of extant jawed vertebrates (also called 
      gnathostomes). To understand RAR diversification, the members of the cyclostomes 
      (lamprey and hagfish), jawless vertebrates representing the extant sister group of 
      gnathostomes, provide an intermediate situation and thus allow the characterization 
      of the evolutionary steps that shaped RAR ligand-binding properties following the 
      WGDs. In this study, we assessed the ligand-binding specificity of cyclostome RARs 
      and found that their ligand-binding pockets resemble those of gnathostome RARα and 
      RARβ. In contrast, none of the cyclostome receptors studied showed any RARγ-like 
      specificity. Together, our results suggest that cyclostome RARs cover only a portion 
      of the specificity repertoire of the ancestral gnathostome RARs and indicate that 
      the establishment of ligand-binding specificity was a stepwise event. This iterative 
      process thus provides a rare example for the diversification of receptor-ligand 
      interactions of NRs following WGDs.

TI  - The immunoglobulins of cold-blooded vertebrates.
PG  - 1045-69
LID - 10.3390/biom4041045 [doi]
AB  - Although lymphocyte-like cells secreting somatically-recombining receptors have been 
      identified in the jawless fishes (hagfish and lamprey), the cartilaginous fishes 
      (sharks, skates, rays and chimaera) are the most phylogenetically distant group 
      relative to mammals in which bona fide immunoglobulins (Igs) have been found. 
      Studies of the antibodies and humoral immune responses of cartilaginous fishes and 
      other cold-blooded vertebrates (bony fishes, amphibians and reptiles) are not only 
      revealing information about the emergence and roles of the different Ig heavy and 
      light chain isotypes, but also the evolution of specialised adaptive features such 
      as isotype switching, somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation. It is becoming 
      increasingly apparent that while the adaptive immune response in these vertebrate 
      lineages arose a long time ago, it is most definitely not primitive and has evolved 
      to become complex and sophisticated. This review will summarise what is currently 
      known about the immunoglobulins of cold-blooded vertebrates and highlight the 
      differences, and commonalities, between these and more "conventional" mammalian 
      species.

AB  - Maximal activities of creatine kinase, pyruvate kinase and cytochrome oxidase and 
      total concentrations of creatine and phosphorylated adenylates were measured in 
      cardiac muscle of hagfish, eight teleost species, frog, turtle, pigeon and rat. The 
      ratio of creatine kinase to cytochrome oxidase with cytochrome oxidase as a rough 
      estimate of aerobic capacity and cellular "energy turnover", was increased in 
      myocardia of hagfish, turtle and crucian carp. These myocardia are likely to be 
      frequently exposed to oxygen deficiency. In agreement with this, they possess a high 
      relative glycolytic capacity as indicated by a high pyruvate kinase/cytochrome 
      oxidase ratio. The creatine kinase/cytochrome oxidase ratio for the other myocardia 
      varied within a factor of 2, except the value for cod myocardium which was below the 
      others. Total creatine varied among species and was high in active species such as 
      herring, pigeon and rat but also high in crucian carp. The variation in total 
      concentration of phosphorylated adenylates was considerably less than the variation 
      in total creatine. The high creatine kinase/cytochrome oxidase ratio in myocardia 
      likely to be challenged by hypoxia may represent an enhanced efficiency for both 
      "spatial" and "temporal" buffering of phosphorylated adenylates to attenuate the 
      impact of a depressed energy liberation. As to the differences in total creatine, 
      this factor influences not only the cellular energy distribution but possibly also 
      contractility via an effect on the free phosphate level.

AB  - The corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) system, which includes the CRH family of 
      peptides, their receptors (CRHRs) and a binding protein (CRHBP), has been strongly 
      conserved throughout vertebrate evolution. The identification of invertebrate 
      homologues suggests this system evolved over 500 million years ago. However, the 
      early vertebrate evolution of the CRH system is not understood. Current theory 
      indicates that agnathans (hagfishes and lampreys) are monophyletic with a 
      conservative evolution over the past 500million years and occupy a position at the 
      root of vertebrate phylogeny. We isolated the cDNAs for three CRH family members, 
      two CRHRs and a CRHBP from the sea lamprey, Petromyzon marinus. Two of the CRH 
      peptides are related to the CRH/urotensin-1 (UI) lineage, whereas the other is a 
      urocortin (Ucn) 3 orthologue. The predicted amino acid identity of CRH and UI is 61% 
      but they possess distinct motifs indicative of each peptide, suggesting an early 
      divergence of the two genes. Based on our findings we propose the CRH peptides 
      evolved in at least 3 distinct phases. The first occurring prior to the agnathans 
      gave rise to the CRH/UI-like and Ucn2/3-like paralogous lineages. The second was a 
      partial sub-genomic duplication of the ancestral CRH/UI-like gene, but not the 
      Ucn2/3-like gene, giving rise to the CRH and UI (Ucn) lineages. The third event 
      which resulted in the appearance of Ucn2 and Ucn3 must have occurred after the 
      evolution of the cartilaginous fishes. Interestingly, unlike other vertebrate CRHRs, 
      we were unable to classify our two P. marinus receptors (designated CRHRα and CRHRβ) 
      as either type 1 or type 2, indicating that this split evolved later in vertebrate 
      evolution. A single CRHBP gene was found suggesting that either this gene has not 
      been affected by the vertebrate genome duplications or there have been a series of 
      paralogous gene deletions. This study suggests that P. marinus possess a functional 
      CRH system that differs from that of the gnathostomes and may represent a model for 
      the earliest functioning CRH system in vertebrates.

AB  - In contrast to an earlier report, we find that the primitive vertebrate Eptatretus 
      possesses a muscle lactate dehydrogenase whose molecular size is like that of 
      lactate dehydrogenases from higher vertebrates. The molecular size of lactate 
      dehydrogenase appears to have remained constant during evolution.

PG  - R52-60
AB  - Blood-brain and blood-CSF barriers to inulin were compared in 11 vertebrate species. 
      Twenty hours after systemic administration, [14C]inulin penetrated into the central 
      nervous system to an equivalent extent in mudpuppy, salamander (adult and larval), 
      red sculpin, big skate, little skate, southern stingray, and Atlantic stingray with 
      values for RB (dpm/g brain divided by dpm/ml plasma) in the range 0.01- 0.04 and for 
      RCSF (dpm/ml CSF divided by dpm/ml plasma) from 0.02 to 0.04. These values are 
      similar to those reported for mammals. For dogfish, nurse shark, and lemon shark, RB 
      ranged from 0.04 to 0.09 and RCSF from 0.08 to 0.29 and for hagfish RB=0.12, 
      indicating that barrier systems to inulin are poorly developed in sharks and 
      possibly absent in hagfish. Analyses of radiolabeled urea and sucrose penetration 
      into brain and CSF revealed further differences in shark barrier function. Brain 
      barriers to insulin in dogfish and little skate developed with age; in nurse shark 
      there was no detectable change in the inulin ratios over the weight range, 0.2-110 
      kg.

TI  - EVOLUTION OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE. I. THE PHYLOGENETIC DEVELOPMENT OF ADAPTIVE 
      IMMUNOLOGIC RESPONSIVENESS IN VERTEBRATES.
PG  - 105-30
AB  - 1. The California hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii, seems to be completely lacking in 
      adaptive immunity: it forms no detectable circulating antibody despite intensive 
      stimulation with a range of antigens; it does not show reactivity to old tuberculin 
      following sensitization with BCG; and gives no evidence of homograft immunity. 2. 
      Studies on the sea lamprey, Petromyzon marinus, have been limited to the response to 
      bacteriophage T(2) and hemocyanin in small groups of spawning animals. They suggest 
      that the lamprey may have a low degree of immunologic reactivity. 3. One holostean, 
      the bowfin (Amia calva) and the guitarfish (Rhinobatos productus), an elasmobranch, 
      showed a low level of primary response to phage and hemocyanin. The response is slow 
      and antibody levels low. Both the bowfin and the guitarfish showed a vigorous 
      secondary response to phage, but neither showed much enhancement of reactivity to 
      hemocyanin in the secondary response. The bowfin formed precipitating antibody to 
      hemocyanin, but the guitarfish did not. Both hemagglutinating and precipitating 
      antibody to hemocyanin were also observed in the primary response of the black bass. 
      4. The bowfin was successfully sensitized to Ascaris antigen, and lesions of the 
      delayed type developed after challenge at varying intervals following sensitization. 
      5. The horned shark (Heterodontus franciscii) regularly cleared hemocyanin from the 
      circulation after both primary and secondary antigenic stimulation, and regularly 
      formed hemagglutinating antibody, but not precipitating antibody, after both primary 
      and secondary stimulation with this antigen. These animals regularly cleared 
      bacteriophage from the circulation after both the primary and secondary stimulation 
      with bacteriophage T(2). Significant but small amounts of antibody were produced in 
      a few animals in the primary response, and larger amounts in the responding animals 
      after secondary antigenic stimulation. 6. Studies by starch gel and 
      immunoelectrophoresis show that the hagfish has no bands with mobilities of 
      mammalian gamma globulins; that the lamprey has a single, relatively faint band of 
      this type; and that multiple gamma bands are characteristic of the holostean, 
      elasmobranchs, and teleosts studied. By this method of study, the bowfin appeared to 
      have substantial amounts of gamma(2) globulin. 7. We conclude that adaptive immunity 
      and its cellular and humoral correlates developed in the lowest vertebrates, and 
      that a rising level of immunologic reactivity and an increasingly differentiated and 
      complex immunologic mechanism are observed going up the phylogenetic scale from the 
      hagfish, to the lamprey, to the elasmobranchs, to the holosteans, and finally the 
      teleosts.

AB  - The fishery of inshore hagfish (Eptatretus burgeri) is particularly important from 
      the perspective of the eel-skin leather industry in the northwest Pacific. In order 
      to reveal the genetic diversity and population structure of E. burgeri in the 
      northwest Pacific, we analyzed partial nucleotide sequences of three mitochondrial 
      DNA regions (523 bp in COI, 712 bp in ND4 and 617 bp in Cytb) based on specimens 
      collected from six locations in Korea and Japan. The genetic diversities of E. 
      burgeri were higher in Korean locations compared to Japanese ones. AMOVA showed that 
      E. burgeri was completely separated into two groups (group A: southern coast of 
      Korea and western coast of Japan vs. group B: eastern coast of Japan). Furthermore, 
      groups A and B were divided into each two lineages (lineage I: west southern coast 
      of Korea, lineage II: east southern coast of Korea and western coast of Japan, 
      lineage III and IV: eastern coast of Japan). Our molecular results suggest that 
      these two groups and lineages of E. burgeri may be different evolutionary 
      significant unit and management unit, respectively.

TI  - Oxidative enzymes in the urinary apparatus of several marine fishes.
PG  - 49-72
AB  - The distribution and activities of several oxidative enzymes in the urinary 
      apparatus of seven marine fish species (hagfish, lesser spotted dogfish, electric 
      ray, herring, marine catfish, cod, sea-horse) have been studied. Species were 
      selected from three main taxonomic groups: Cyclostomata, Elasmobranchii and 
      Teleostei. Distinctly positive enzyme reactions were found in the tubular elements 
      of the kidney and the collecting duct-archinephric duct system, with the exception 
      of the generally weak staining intensities for NADP-linked malate dehydrogenase. In 
      the proximal tubule segment the second, ore distal part (PII) reacted, in general, 
      very strongly when compared with the first proximal part (PI). If present, the 
      distal tubule in teleosts showed only weak reactions, while this segment in 
      elasmobranchs exhibited moderate to strong enzyme activities. In the epithelial 
      cells of the collecting tubule-collecting duct system stronger reactions were 
      confined to the glomerular teleost species, the corresponding part of the 
      elasmobranch kidney showing weak staining intensities. In the urinary duct system 
      distinctly positive enzyme reactions were only to be found in the archinephric duct 
      of the teleost species, except for Plotosus. The ureters of the elasmobranchs 
      exhibited weak enzymes activities throughout. The enzyme patterns of the various 
      types of urinary tubules and ducts are compared with observations from several 
      morphological and physiological studies. The histochemical findings are discussed in 
      relation to corresponding investigations of freshwater fishes and problems arising 
      from phylogenetic divergence of marine fish groups.

TI  - Blood and extracellular fluid volume in whole body and tissues of the Pacific 
      hagfish, Eptatretus stouti.
PG  - 750-6
AB  - Whole-body and 20 individual-tissue (51)Cr-RBC (red cell space; RCS) and 
      (99)Tc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (extracellular space; ECS) spaces were 
      measured in seven unanesthetized Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stouti). Volume 
      indicators were administered via a dorsal aortic cannula implanted the previous day. 
      Blood samples were collected at 6, 12, 18, and 24 h after injection. Tissues were 
      removed at 24 h and radioactivity was measured; tissue water content (percent of wet 
      weight) was determined by desiccation at 95 degrees C for 48 h. Mixing rates of both 
      indicators were identical and were essentially complete by 12 h, indicating that 
      blood convection is the rate-limiting process. At 24 h, the whole-body RCS was 
      19.3+/-2.1 mL kg(-1) body weight, and the ECS was 338.5+/-15.2 mL kg(-1) body 
      weight. Blood volume estimated from the 24-h RCS and the mean central hematocrit 
      (14%) was 137.9 mL kg(-1) body weight. Liver RCS (118.6+/-30.5 microL g(-1) tissue 
      weight) was twice that of any other tissue and was also the most variable, ranging 
      from 59 to 263 microL g(-1), whereas liver ECS (406.0+/-34.3 microL g(-1)) was in 
      the range of other tissues, and water content (66.9%+/-3.5%) was low. Gill RCS 
      (55.9+/-5.7 microL g(-1)), ECS (415.3+/-37.7 microL g(-1)), and percent water 
      (83.1%+/-0.8%) were higher than most other tissues. RCS, ECS, and percent water were 
      consistently lowest in ovum (1.1+/-0.02 microL g(-1), 111.1+/-4.3 microL g(-1), 
      51.3%+/-3.5%, respectively). Tongue, notocord, and myotome had generally lower RCS 
      (2.1+/-0.4, 2.2+/-0.5, 7.1+/-0.1 microL g(-1), respectively) and ECS (121.2+/-7.0, 
      246.3+/-17.4, 185.3+/-16.7 microL g(-1), respectively), although their water content 
      was in the midrange (74.7+/-0.5, 81.2+/-1.6, 74.4%+/-0.6%, respectively). Skin had a 
      low RCS (6.8+/-1.1) and midrange ECS (387.5+/-28.0) but very low water content 
      (61.2%+/-2.1%). These findings confirm that hagfish blood volume is at least twice 
      as large as other fish, whereas our estimate of extracellular fluid volume is larger 
      than previously reported and more in line with the predicted interstitial volume. 
      RCS, ECS, and water content vary, often independently, between tissues, which may 
      perhaps be indicative of specific tissue needs or functions. A distinct spleen is 
      lacking in hagfish, and the liver appears to serve this function by sequestering red 
      cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report of tissue ECS in Myxiniformes.

LID - 10.1021/bm401600a [doi]
AB  - Hagfish slime threads were recently established as a promising biomimetic model for 
      efforts to produce ecofriendly alternatives to petroleum polymers. Initial attempts 
      to make fibers from solubilized slime thread proteins fell short of achieving the 
      outstanding mechanics of native slime threads. Here we tested the hypothesis that 
      the high strength and toughness of slime threads arise from the ability of 
      constituent intermediate filaments to undergo a stress-induced α-to-β transition. To 
      do this, we made fibers from human vimentin proteins that were first allowed to 
      self-assemble into 10 nm intermediate filaments. Fibers made from assembled vimentin 
      hydrogels underwent an α-to-β transition when strained and exhibited improved 
      mechanical performance. Our data demonstrate that it is possible to make materials 
      from intermediate filament hydrogels and that mimicking the secondary structure of 
      native hagfish slime threads using intermediate filament self-assembly is a 
      promising strategy for improving the mechanical performance of biomimetic protein 
      materials.

TI  - Methylation of genomes and genes at the invertebrate-vertebrate boundary.
PG  - 1469-75
AB  - Patterns of DNA methylation in animal genomes are known to vary from an apparent 
      absence of modified bases, via methylation of a minor fraction of the genome, to 
      genome-wide methylation. Representative genomes from 10 invertebrate phyla comprise 
      predominantly nonmethylated DNA and (usually but not always) a minor fraction of 
      methylated DNA. In contrast, all 27 vertebrate genomes that have been examined 
      display genome-wide methylation. Our studies of chordate genomes suggest that the 
      transition from fractional to global methylation occurred close to the origin of 
      vertebrates, as amphioxus has a typically invertebrate methylation pattern whereas 
      primitive vertebrates (hagfish and lamprey) have patterns that are typical of 
      vertebrates. Surprisingly, methylation of genes preceded this transition, as many 
      invertebrate genes have turned out to be heavily methylated. Methylation does not 
      preferentially affect genes whose expression is highly regulated, as several 
      housekeeping genes are found in the heavily methylated fraction whereas several 
      genes expressed in a tissue-specific manner are in the nonmethylated fraction.

TI  - Scavenger endothelial cells of fish, a review.
PG  - 1385-1397
LID - 10.1111/jfd.13396 [doi]
AB  - The definition of scavenger endothelial cells (SEC) is exclusively based on 
      functional and structural characteristics. The following characteristics are common 
      hallmarks for the vertebrate SEC: (a) All vertebrates examined are furnished with a 
      population of special SEC that plays a role in the catabolism of physiologic and 
      non-physiologic soluble waste macromolecules. (b) From the ligands that are 
      endocytosed, SEC in all seven vertebrate classes appear to express the collagen 
      α-chain receptor and the scavenger receptors. In addition, the hyaluronan and the 
      mannose receptors are present on SEC of mammalia (several species) and osteichthyes 
      (e.g., salmon and cod). It is likely that all four receptor types are present in all 
      vertebrate classes. (c) Like liver endothelial cells (LEC) in mammals, SEC in all 
      vertebrate classes are geared to endocytosis of soluble macromolecules, but 
      phagocytic uptake of particles is taken care of mainly by macrophages. (d) The most 
      primitive vertebrates (hagfish, lamprey and ray) carry their SEC in gill vessels, 
      whereas phylogenetically younger fishes (salmon, carp, cod and plaice) carry their 
      SEC in either kidney or heart and in all terrestrial vertebrates-SEC are found 
      exclusively in the liver. (e) SEC of all vertebrates are localized in blood 
      sinusoids or trabeculae that carry large amounts of slowly flowing and O(2) poor 
      blood. (f) SEC differs functionally and structurally from what is normally 
      associated with "conventional vascular endothelium."

TI  - [Comparative studies of the anatomy of the brain in three species of Agnatha: 
      Petromyzon marinus, Lampetra fluviatilis and Lampetra planeri].
PG  - 23-32
AB  - This study has been carried out upon 3 species of Petromyzonts: Petromyzon marinus, 
      Lampetra fluviatilis and Lampetra planeri. According to the values of the index of 
      encephalization (whole brain) and to these of the structures indices (brain 
      subdivisions), similarities as well as differences have been pointed out. Other 
      detail are brought by the relative volume of these subdivisions expressed by a per 
      cent value of the entire brain volume (the ventricular volumes being removed). 1. 
      The indices of encephalization show that the Sea Lamprey is the less encephalized 
      species amongst Vertebrates (with an arbitrary value of 10); but the 2 other 
      lampreys stay at a higher level (respectively 44 and 38) while the Hagfish reaches 
      54 and the average encephalization index of bony fishes locates at the 100 value. 2. 
      The relative volumes lead to a quantified brain pattern which characterizes the both 
      3 Lampreys with regard to the other species of Vertebrates: olfactory bulbs are well 
      developed, more than the cerebral hemispheres; at the same time the so-called 
      structure Tegmentum + Medulla oblongata holds about 50% of the entire brain volume. 
      This dual pecularity may be considered as the expression of a primitive status. 3. 
      The structure indices (each of it being fixed at 10 for the Sea Lamprey) are 
      uniformly higher in the 2 Lampetra (with a step of 20 to 30 unities of index). It 
      seems to be, this time, the expression of an inner evolution in Petromyzonts, but 
      remaining the basic pattern of the group. Some examples taken amongst other 
      Vertebrates emphasize this pecularity: Polypterus possess high indices for the 
      cerebral hemispheres (595: processus of telencephalization) and cerebellum (1250). 
      On the other hand the Sturgeon shows low values for all the subdivisions, except 
      cerebellum (549). Finally, the Hagfish withdraws from the brain pattern of Lamprey 
      because its indices are clearly higher for olfactory lobes (141) and diencephalon 
      (113).

TI  - Genome duplication in early vertebrates: insights from agnathan cytogenetics.
PG  - 80-9
LID - 10.1159/000354098 [doi]
AB  - Agnathans represent a remnant of a primitive offshoot of the vertebrates, and the 
      long evolutionary separation between their 2 living groups, namely hagfishes and 
      lampreys, could explain profound biological differences, also in karyotypes and 
      genome sizes. Here, cytogenetic studies available on these vertebrates were 
      summarized and data discussed with reference to the recently demonstrated monophyly 
      of this group and to the 2 events of whole genome duplication (1R and 2R) 
      characterizing the evolution of vertebrates. The comparison of cytogenetic data and 
      phylogenetic relationships among agnathans and gnathostomes seems to support the 
      hypothesis that 1R and 2R occurred before the evolutionary divergence between 
      jawless and jawed vertebrates.

TI  - Chromatin diminution in the copepod Mesocyclops edax: diminution of tandemly 
      repeated DNA families from somatic cells.
PG  - 657-65
AB  - Chromatin diminution, i.e., the loss of selected chromosomal regions during the 
      differentiation of early embryonic cells into somatic cells, has been described in 
      taxa as varied as ciliates, copepods, insects, nematodes, and hagfish. The nature of 
      the eliminated DNA has been extensively studied in ciliate, nematode, and hagfish 
      species. However, the small size of copepods, which makes it difficult to obtain 
      enough DNA from early embryonic cells for cloning and sequencing, has limited such 
      studies. Here, to identify the sequences eliminated from the somatic cells of a 
      copepod species that undergoes chromatin diminution, we randomly amplified DNA 
      fragments from germ line and somatic line cells of Mesocyclops edax, a freshwater 
      cyclopoid copepod. Of 47 randomly amplified germ line clones, 45 (96%) contained 
      short, tandemly repeated sequences composed of either 2 bp CA-repeats, 8 bp 
      CAAATAGA-repeats, or 9 bp CAAATTAAA-repeats. In contrast, of 83 randomly amplified 
      somatic line clones, only 47 (57%) contained such short, tandemly repeated 
      sequences. As previously observed in some nematode species, our results therefore 
      show that there is partial elimination of chromosomal regions containing (CAAATAGA 
      and CAAATTAAA) repeated sequences during the chromatin diminution observed in the 
      somatic cells of M. edax. We speculate that chromatin diminution might have evolved 
      repeatedly by recruitment of RNAi-related mechanisms to eliminate nonfunctional 
      tandemly repeated DNA sequences from the somatic genome of some species.

TI  - CO2 transport in agnathan blood: evidence of erythrocyte Cl-/HCO3- exchange 
      limitations.
PG  - 335-47
AB  - CO2 transport properties of blood were examined in the lamprey Petromyzon marinus 
      and the hagfish Myxine glutinosa. In order to evaluate possible chloride/bicarbonate 
      exchange limitations, experiments were conducted under control conditions and in the 
      presence of an ionophore to permit equilibrium distribution of chloride, 
      bicarbonate, and protons across the erythrocyte membrane. The ionophore, 
      tri-n-propyl tin chloride, markedly altered the CO2 transport properties and 
      apparent nonbicarbonate buffering characteristics of the blood of Petromyzon 
      marinus. In addition, the distributions of protons, bicarbonate and chloride ions 
      across the erythrocyte membrane were very different from each other under control 
      conditions, but became very similar in the presence of the anionic ionophore. The 
      CO2 transport properties of the blood of Myxine glutinosa were not significantly 
      different in the presence of the ionophore. Small but significant changes were 
      observed, however, in erythrocyte pH, chloride concentration and water content in 
      the presence of tri-n-propyl tin chloride. These results demonstrate that 
      chloride/bicarbonate exchange limitations and possibly active transport of protons 
      contribute to the unique CO2 transport properties in the blood of the lamprey, 
      Petromyzon marinus. In the hagfish, Myxine glutinosa, the importance of anion 
      exchange limitations or active proton transport with regard to the CO2 carrying 
      properties of the blood are clearly much less than in the lamprey under the in vitro 
      conditions of this study.

AB  - Considering that life on earth evolved about 3.7 billion years ago, vertebrates are 
      young, appearing in the fossil record during the Cambrian explosion about 542 to 515 
      million years ago. Results from sequence analyses of genomes from bacteria, yeast, 
      plants, invertebrates and vertebrates indicate that receptors for adrenal steroids 
      (aldosterone, cortisol), and sex steroids (estrogen, progesterone, testosterone) 
      also are young, with an estrogen receptor and a 3-ketosteroid receptor first 
      appearing in basal chordates (cephalochordates: amphioxus), which are close 
      ancestors of vertebrates. Duplication and divergence of the 3-ketosteroid receptor 
      yielded an ancestral progesterone receptor and an ancestral corticoid receptor, the 
      common ancestor of the glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors, in jawless 
      vertebrates (cyclostomes: lampreys, hagfish). This was followed by evolution of an 
      androgen receptor, distinct glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors and 
      estrogen receptor-α and -β in cartilaginous fishes (Chondrichthyes: sharks). Further 
      evolution of mineralocorticoid signaling occurred with the evolution of aldosterone 
      synthase in lungfish, a forerunner of terrestrial vertebrates. Adrenal and sex 
      steroid receptors are not found in echinoderms and hemichordates, which are 
      ancestors in the lineage of cephalochordates and vertebrates. The evolution of 
      steroid receptors at key nodes in the evolution of vertebrates, in which steroid 
      receptors act as master switches to regulate differentiation, development, 
      reproduction, immune responses, electrolyte homeostasis and stress responses, 
      suggests an important role for steroid receptors in the evolutionary success of 
      vertebrates, considering that the human genome contains about 22,000 genes, which is 
      not much larger than genomes of invertebrates, such as Caenorhabditis elegans

AB  - The purpose of this study is to identify evolutionary origin and fate of anatomic 
      features of the duck-billed platypus eye. Eyes from the duck-billed platypus and 
      four key evolutionary basal vertebrates (Pacific hagfish, north hemisphere sea 
      lamprey, and Australian and South American lungfishes) were prepared for light 
      microscopy. In addition to a standard panel of stains, tissues were immunostained 
      against a variety of rod and cone opsins. Finally, published opsin sequences of 
      platypus and several other vertebrate species were aligned and compared with 
      immunohistochemical results. A complete scleral cartilage similar to that seen in 
      birds, reptiles and amphibians encloses the platypus eye. This feature is present in 
      sharks and rays, and in extant relatives of tetrapods, the lungfishes. The choroid 
      lacks a tapetum. The retina is largely avascular and is rod-dominated, with a 
      minority of red- and blue- cone immunoreactive photoreceptors. Like marsupials and 
      many nonmammalian vertebrates, cones contain clear inner segment droplets. Double 
      cones were present, a feature not found in eutherian mammals or marsupials. 
      Evaluation of opsins indicates that red and blue immunoreactive cone opsins, but not 
      rhodopsin, are present in the most basal of the extant species examined, the Pacific 
      hagfish. Rhodopsin appears in the Australian and South American lungfishes, 
      establishing emergence of this pigment in an extant relative of tetrapods. Unlike 
      eyes of eutherian mammals, the platypus eye has retained morphologic features 
      present in early tetrapods such as amphibians and their evolutionarily basal sister 
      group, the lungfishes. These include scleral cartilage, double cones and cone 
      droplets. In the platypus, as in other mammals, rod rhodopsin is the predominant 
      photoreceptor pigment, at expense of the cone system.

AB  - In mammalian blood coagulation, five proteases (factor VII [FVII]; factor IX [FIX]; 
      factor X [FX]; protein C [PC] and prothrombin [PT]) act with five cofactors (tissue 
      factor [TF]; factor V [FV]; factor VIII [FVIII]; thrombomodulin and protein S) to 
      control the generation of fibrin. Biochemical evidence, molecular cloning data and 
      comparative sequence analysis support the existence of all components of this 
      network in all jawed vertebrates, and strongly suggest that it evolved before the 
      divergence of teleosts over 430 million years ago. Phylogenetic analysis of the 
      amino acid sequences of the Gla-EGF1-EGF2-SP domain serine proteases (FVII, FIX, FX, 
      PC) and the A domain-containing cofactors (FV and FVIII) strongly supports the 
      evolution of the blood coagulation network through two rounds of gene duplication, 
      and supports the hypothesis that vertebrate evolution benefited from two global 
      genome duplications. The jawless vertebrates (hagfish and lamprey) that diverged 
      over 450 million years ago have a blood coagulation network involving TF, PT and 
      fibrinogen. Preliminary evidence indicates that they may have a smaller complement 
      of Gla-EGF1-EGF2-SP domain proteins, suggesting the existence of a 'primitive' 
      coagulation system in jawless vertebrates.

TI  - Evolution of taste and solitary chemoreceptor cell systems.
PG  - 234-43
AB  - Vertebrates possess four distinct chemosensory systems distinguishable on the basis 
      of structure, innervation and utilization: olfaction, taste, solitary chemoreceptor 
      cells (SCC) and the common chemical sense (free nerve endings). Of these, taste and 
      the SCC sense rely on secondary receptor cells situated in the epidermis and 
      synapsing on sensory nerve fibers innervating them near their base. The SCC sense 
      occurs in anamniote aquatic craniates, including hagfish, and may be used for 
      feeding or predator avoidance. The sense of taste occurs only in vertebrates and is 
      always utilized for feeding. The SCC system achieves a high degree of specialization 
      in two teleosts: sea robins (Prionotus) and rocklings (Ciliata). In sea robins, SCCs 
      are abundant on the three anterior fin rays of the pectoral fin which are free of 
      fin webbing and are used in active exploration of the substrate. Behavioral and 
      physiological studies show that this SCC system responds to feeding cues and drives 
      feeding behavior. It is connected centrally like a somatosensory system. In 
      contrast, the specialized SCC system of rocklings occurs on the anterior dorsal fin 
      which actively samples the surrounding water. This system responds to mucus 
      substances and may serve as a predator detector. The SCC system in rocklings is 
      connected centrally like a gustatory system. Taste buds contain multiple receptor 
      cell types, including a serotonergic Merkel-like cell. Taste receptor cells respond 
      to nutritionally relevant substances. Due to similarities between SCCs and one type 
      of taste receptor cell, the suggestion is made that taste buds may be compound 
      sensory organs that include some cells related to SCCs and others related to 
      cutaneous Merkel cells. The lack of taste buds in hagfish and their presence in all 
      vertebrates may indicate that the phylogenetic development of taste buds coincided 
      with the elaboration of head structures at the craniate-vertebrate transition.

TI  - Genetic and functional analysis of a Pacific hagfish opioid system.
PG  - 19-34
LID - 10.1002/jnr.24682 [doi]
AB  - The actions of endogenous opioids and nociceptin/orphanin FQ are mediated by four 
      homologous G protein-coupled receptors that constitute the opioid receptor family. 
      However, little is known about opioid systems in cyclostomes (living jawless fish) 
      and how opioid systems might have evolved from invertebrates. Here, we leveraged de 
      novo transcriptome and low-coverage whole-genome assembly in the Pacific hagfish 
      (Eptatretus stoutii) to identify and characterize the first full-length coding 
      sequence for a functional opioid receptor in a cyclostome. Additionally, we define 
      two novel endogenous opioid precursors in this species that predict several novel 
      opioid peptides. Bioinformatic analysis shows no closely related opioid receptor 
      genes in invertebrates with regard either to the genomic organization or to 
      conserved opioid receptor-specific sequences that are common in all vertebrates. 
      Furthermore, no proteins analogous to vertebrate opioid precursors could be 
      identified by genomic searches despite previous claims of protein or RNA-derived 
      sequences in several invertebrate species. The presence of an expressed orthologous 
      receptor and opioid precursors in the Pacific hagfish confirms that a functional 
      opioid system was likely present in the common ancestor of all extant vertebrates 
      some 550 million years ago, earlier than all previous authenticated accounts. We 
      discuss the premise that the cyclostome and vertebrate opioid systems evolved from 
      invertebrate systems concerned with antimicrobial defense and speculate that the 
      high concentrations of opioid precursors in tissues such as the testes, gut, and 
      activated immune cells are key remnants of this evolutionary role.

TI  - Aryl hydrocarbon receptor function in early vertebrates: inducibility of cytochrome 
      P450 1A in agnathan and elasmobranch fish.
PG  - 67-75
AB  - The mammalian aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription 
      factor that controls the expression of cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) genes in response 
      to halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin 
      (TCDD). The natural ligand and normal physiologic function of this protein are as 
      yet unknown. One approach to understanding AHR function and significance is to 
      determine the evolutionary history of this receptor and of processes such as CYP1A 
      induction that are controlled by the AHR in mammals. In these studies, AHR function 
      was evaluated in representative cartilaginous fish (little skate, Raja erinacea) and 
      jawless fish (sea lamprey, Petromyzon marinus and Atlantic hagfish, Myxine 
      glutinosa), using CYP1A induction as a model AHR-dependent response. Treatment of 
      skate with beta-naphthoflavone (BNF) caused an 8-fold increase in hepatic 
      ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity as well as a 37-fold increase in the 
      content of immunodetectable CYP1A protein. Evidence of CYP1A inducibility was also 
      obtained for another cartilaginous fish, the smooth dogfish Mustelus canis. In 
      contrast, hepatic EROD activity was not detected in untreated lamprey nor in lamprey 
      treated with 3,3'4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (TCB), a potent AHR agonist in teleosts. A 
      possible CYP1A homolog was detected in lamprey hepatic microsomes by one of three 
      antibodies to teleost CYP1A, but expression of this protein was not altered by TCB 
      treatment. CYP1A protein and catalytic activity were measurable in hagfish, but 
      neither was induced after treatment with TCB. These results suggest that the 
      AHR-CYP1A signal transduction pathway is highly conserved in gnathostomes, but that 
      there may be fundamental differences in AHR signaling or AHR-CYP1A coupling in 
      agnathan fish. Agnathan fish such as hagfish and lamprey may be interesting model 
      species for examining possible ancestral AHR functions not related to CYP1A 
      regulation.

TI  - Neuroendocrine control of reproduction in lampreys.
PG  - 365-74
LID - 10.1007/BF00003368 [doi]
AB  - In most vertebrate classes, the hypothalamus and pituitary have well-defined roles 
      in the control of reproduction. Until recently, there was little evidence for 
      neuroendocrine control of reproduction in lampreys, one of the only two living 
      representative groups of the oldest lineage of vertebrates, the Agnathans. The 
      question whether there is hypothalamic control over reproduction has special 
      significance since these fishes, with the hagfishes, are modern descendants of the 
      most primitive vertebrates available for study. This paper summarizes the studies on 
      the structure and function of lamprey GnRH which provide evidence for the regulatory 
      influence of the hypothalamus on the pituitary-gonadal axis. These data imply that 
      evolution of this mechanism most likely antedated the origin of all known 
      vertebrates.

TI  - Evolution of the vestibulo-ocular system.
PG  - 182-92
AB  - The evolutionary and developmental changes in the eye muscle innervation, the inner 
      ear, and the vestibulo-ocular reflex are examined. Three eye muscle patterns, based 
      on the innervation by distinct ocular motoneurons populations, can be identified: a 
      lamprey, an elasmobranch, and a bony fish/tetrapod pattern. Four distinct patterns 
      of variation in the vestibular system are described: a hagfish pattern, a lamprey 
      pattern, an elasmobranch pattern, and a bony fish/tetrapod pattern. Developmental 
      data suggest an influence of the hindbrain on ear pattern formation, thus 
      potentially allowing a concomitant change of eye muscle innervation and ear 
      variation. The connections between the ear and the vestibular nuclei and between the 
      vestibular nuclei and ocular motoneurons are reviewed, and the role of neurotrophins 
      for pattern specification is discussed. Three patterns are recognized in central 
      projections: a hagfish pattern, a lamprey pattern, and a pattern for jawed 
      vertebrates. Second-order connections show both similarities and differences between 
      distantly related species such as lampreys and mammals. For example, elasmobranchs 
      lack an internuclear system, which is at best poorly developed in lampreys. It is 
      suggested that the vestibulo-ocular system shows only a limited degree of variation 
      because of the pronounced functional constraints imposed on it.

TI  - Structural analysis of the molecular evolution of some gastro-entero-pancreatic 
      hormones.
PG  - 26-36
AB  - By means of a statistical analysis of the occurrence of amino-acid residues in the 
      polypeptide chains of several gastro-entero-pancreatic (GEP) hormones an 
      investigation was undertaken to determine whether any of these hormones might be 
      related to each other--possibly from an evolutionary point of view. Particular 
      interest was paid to the occurrence of small charged segments, i.e. those with 
      acidic or basic amino acid residues, since such segments can be presumed to play a 
      role in hormonal receptor binding mechanisms. By this method hormonal relationships 
      were suggested by the observation that these small charged amino-acid sequences, 
      contained in the hormonal structures, match as a result of non-randomness. It was 
      found that hagfish and human insulin were related on a molecular level not only to 
      the newly discovered (avian, bovine, human) pancreatic polypeptide (PP) but also to 
      some other GEP hormones (VIP, GIP, glucagon) as well as to calcitonin and to the 
      alpha-subunit of the glycoprotein hormones. Interpretation of the statistical data 
      suggests that all these peptide hormones are related by a common hexapeptide 
      sequence which contributed, at an evolutionary point, to their molecular 
      architecture. A hexapeptide segment of APP is statistically related to a sequence of 
      equal size in the carboxy terminal region of the A-chain of both hagfish and human 
      insulin, providing the first instance of their structural similarity. Correlations 
      between PP, insulin, glucagon, VIP, and calcitonin provide a tentative basis for 
      predicting the production of one or more of these peptide hormones by immature or 
      de-differentiated cells of neoplasms and non-neoplastic pathologic lesions of the 
      GEP endocrine system.

TI  - Passive Immunization with Recombinant Antibody VLRB-PirA(vp)/PirB(vp)-Enriched Feeds 
      against Vibrio parahaemolyticus Infection in Litopenaeus vannamei Shrimp.
LID - 10.3390/vaccines9010055 [doi]
LID - 55
AB  - The causative agent of acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) is the 
      bacterium, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, which secretes toxins into the gastrointestinal 
      tract of its host. Vibrio parahaemolyticus toxins A and B (PirA(vp)/PirB(vp)) have 
      been implicated in the pathogenesis of this disease, and are, therefore, the focus 
      of studies developing treatments for AHPND. We previously produced recombinant 
      antibodies based on the hagfish variable lymphocyte receptor B (VLRB) capable of 
      neutralizing some viruses, suggesting that this type of antibody may have a 
      potential application for treatment of AHPND. Here, recombinant PirA(vp)/PirB(vp), 
      produced using a bacterial expression system, were used as antigens to screen a 
      hagfish VLRB cDNA library to obtain PirA(vp)/PirB(vp)-specific antibodies. A cell 
      line secreting these antibodies was established by screening and cloning the DNA 
      extracted from hagfish B cells. Supernatants collected from cells secreting the 
      PirA(vp)/PirB(vp) antibodies were collected and concentrated, and used to passively 
      immunize shrimp to neutralize the toxins PirA(vp) or PirB(vp) associated with AHPND. 
      Briefly, 10 μg of PirA(vp) and PirB(vp) antibodies, 7C12 and 9G10, respectively, 
      were mixed with the shrimp feed, and fed to shrimp for three days consecutive days 
      prior to experimentally infecting the shrimp with V. parahaemolyticus (containing 
      toxins A and B), and resulting mortalities recorded for six days. Results showed 
      significantly higher level of survival in shrimp fed with the PirB(vp)-9G10 antibody 
      (60%) compared to the group fed the PirA(vp)-7C12 antibody (3%) and the control 
      group (0%). This suggests that VLRB antibodies may be a suitable alternative to 
      immunoglobulin-based antibodies, as passive immunization treatments for effective 
      management of AHPND outbreaks within shrimp farms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The extant vertebrates include cyclostomes (lamprey and hagfish) and 
      crown gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates), but there are various anatomical disparities 
      between these two groups. Conspicuous in the gnathostomes is the neck, which 
      occupies the interfacial domain between the head and trunk, including the occipital 
      part of the cranium, the shoulder girdle, and the cucullaris and hypobranchial 
      muscles (HBMs). Of these, HBMs originate from occipital somites to form the ventral 
      pharyngeal and neck musculature in gnathostomes. Cyclostomes also have HBMs on the 
      ventral pharynx, but lack the other neck elements, including the occipital region, 
      the pectoral girdle, and cucullaris muscles. These anatomical differences raise 
      questions about the evolution of the neck in vertebrates. RESULTS: In this study, we 
      observed developing HBMs as a basis for comparison between the two groups and show 
      that the arrangement of the head-trunk interface in gnathostomes is distinct from 
      that of lampreys. Our comparative analyses reveal that, although HBM precursors 
      initially pass through the lateral side of the pericardium in both groups, the 
      relative positions of the pericardium withrespect to the pharyngeal arches differ 
      between the two, resulting in diverse trajectories of HBMs in gnathostomes and 
      lampreys. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that a heterotopic rearrangement of early 
      embryonic components, including the pericardium and pharyngeal arches, may have 
      played a fundamental role in establishing the gnathostome HBMs, which would also 
      have served as the basis for neck formation in the jawed vertebrate lineage.

TI  - Two cathelicidin genes are present in both rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and 
      atlantic salmon (Salmo salar).
PG  - 185-95
AB  - Further to the previous finding of the rainbow trout rtCATH_1 gene, this paper 
      describes three more cathelicidin genes found in salmonids: two in Atlantic salmon, 
      named asCATH_1 and asCATH_2, and one in rainbow trout, named rtCATH_2. All the three 
      new salmonid cathelicidin genes share the common characteristics of mammalian 
      cathelicidin genes, such as consisting of four exons and possessing a highly 
      conserved preproregion and four invariant cysteines clustered in the C-terminal 
      region of the cathelin-like domain. The asCATH_1 gene is homologous to the rainbow 
      trout rtCATH_1 gene, in that it possesses three repeat motifs of TGGGGGTGGC in exon 
      IV and two cysteine residues in the predicted mature peptide, while the asCATH_2 
      gene and rtCATH_2 gene are homologues of each other, with 96% nucleotide identity. 
      Salmonid cathelicidins possess the same elastase-sensitive residue, threonine, as 
      hagfish cathelicidins and the rabbit CAP18 molecule. The cleavage site of the four 
      salmonid cathelicidins is within a conserved amino acid motif of QKIRTRR, which is 
      at the beginning of the sequence encoded by exon IV. Two 36-residue peptides 
      corresponding to the core part of rtCATH_1 and rtCATH_2 were chemically synthesized 
      and shown to exhibit potent antimicrobial activity. rtCATH_2 was expressed 
      constitutively in gill, head kidney, intestine, skin and spleen, while the 
      expression of rtCATH_1 was inducible in gill, head kidney, and spleen after 
      bacterial challenge. Four cathelicidin genes have now been characterized in 
      salmonids and two were identified in hagfish, confirming that cathelicidin genes 
      evolved early and are likely present in all vertebrates.

TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of the 5-aminolevulinate synthase gene.
PG  - 383-96
AB  - The evolution of 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALS) was studied by acquiring sequence 
      data and generating phylogenetic trees. Gene sequences were already available for a 
      variety of vertebrates (which have both a housekeeping and an erythroid form of the 
      gene), fungi, alpha-proteobacteria, and one protist and one protostome. In order to 
      generate representative trees, ALS sequence data were acquired from various 
      deuterostomes and protostomes. The species and tissues selected for study were 
      beluga whale liver, hagfish blood, sea urchin gonadal tissue, cuttlefish 
      hepatopancreas, horseshoe crab hepatopancreas, and bloodworm blood. The new 
      sequences and those previously published were examined for the presence of 
      heme-regulatory motifs (HRMs) and iron-responsive elements (IREs). The HRMs are 
      present in almost all eukaryotic species, which suggests their fundamental role in 
      the regulation of ALS. The IREs are present in all vertebrate erythroid forms of 
      ALS, which indicates that in those animals, expression of the erythroid form of the 
      enzyme and, hence, hemoglobin production can be influenced by the intracellular 
      content of iron. The new sequences were aligned with previously reported ALS 
      sequences, and phylogenetic analyses were performed. The resulting trees provided 
      evidence regarding the timing of the gene duplication event that led to the two 
      forms of the ALS gene in vertebrates. It appears that the housekeeping and erythroid 
      forms of ALS probably arose before the divergence of hagfish from the deuterostome 
      line leading to the vertebrates. The data also add to the evidence indicating that 
      alpha-proteobacteria are the nearest contemporary relatives of mitochondria.

AB  - Monomeric variable lymphocyte receptor B (VLRB) is one of the smallest binding 
      scaffold (20-25 kDa) from jawless vertebrates, hagfish and lamprey. This relatively 
      new class of binding scaffold has various advantages: i) it has a single peptide 
      composition, amenable to molecular engineering for enhancing its stability and 
      affinity; ii) it has a small size, contributing better tissue penetration and easier 
      production using microorganism expression system. Monomeric arVLRB142, which can 
      specifically bind to the glycoprotein of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), 
      was expressed in Pichia pastoris. High quantity recombinant monomeric arVLRB142 
      (rVLR142(mono)) was purified from 100 ml of culture with a resulting yield of 
      2.6 ±1.3 mg of target protein. Functional studies revealed that the purified 
      rVLR142(mono) can specifically recognize low levels of the target antigen 
      (recombinant glycoprotein) (i.e. as low as 0.1 nM), but also the native glycoprotein 
      of VHSV. The expressed rVLR142(mono) exhibited high levels of stability and it 
      retained it binding capacity over broad temperature (4 °C ~ 60 °C) and pH ranges 
      (pH 1.5-12.5). We developed an effective expression system for mass production of 
      monomeric VLRB based on P. pastoris. The recombinant protein that was obtained 
      offers promising binding avidity and biophysical stability and its potential use in 
      various biotechnological applications.

TI  - Evolutionary origins of taste buds: phylogenetic analysis of purinergic 
      neurotransmission in epithelial chemosensors.
PG  - 130015
LID - 10.1098/rsob.130015 [doi]
LID - 130015
AB  - Taste buds are gustatory endorgans which use an uncommon purinergic signalling 
      system to transmit information to afferent gustatory nerve fibres. In mammals, ATP 
      is a crucial neurotransmitter released by the taste cells to activate the afferent 
      nerve fibres. Taste buds in mammals display a characteristic, highly specific 
      ecto-ATPase (NTPDase2) activity, suggesting a role in inactivation of the 
      neurotransmitter. The purpose of this study was to test whether the presence of 
      markers of purinergic signalling characterize taste buds in anamniote vertebrates 
      and to test whether similar purinergic systems are employed by other exteroceptive 
      chemosensory systems. The species examined include several teleosts, elasmobranchs, 
      lampreys and hagfish, the last of which lacks vertebrate-type taste buds. For 
      comparison, Schreiner organs of hagfish and solitary chemosensory cells (SCCs) of 
      teleosts, both of which are epidermal chemosensory end organs, were also examined 
      because they might be evolutionarily related to taste buds. Ecto-ATPase activity was 
      evident in elongate cells in all fish taste buds, including teleosts, elasmobranchs 
      and lampreys. Neither SCCs nor Schreiner organs show specific ecto-ATPase activity, 
      suggesting that purinergic signalling is not crucial in those systems as it is for 
      taste buds. These findings suggest that the taste system did not originate from SCCs 
      but arose independently in early vertebrates.

TI  - Recognition strategies in the innate immune system of ancestral chordates.
PG  - 1077-87
AB  - Many components of the innate immune system in vertebrates can be reliably traced to 
      urochordates and successful strategies for the detection and elimination of 
      pathogens are present at that level of animal evolution, but the issue of where and 
      how the adaptive immune system emerged is still obscure. There is a paucity of 
      evidence for a gradual transition from the innate immune system of invertebrates to 
      the recombinatorial immune system of higher vertebrates. None of the classical 
      elements of MHC based transplantation immunity (MHC, TCR) or humoral immunity (Ig) 
      have been found in urochordates or Agnathans. Nevertheless there is abundant 
      evidence for adaptive immune responses in the agnathans. This remarkable paradox 
      raises a number of questions. How do these ancestral chordates discriminate between 
      the constituents of the external world and the constituents of "self"? Are these 
      strategies universal within the animal kingdom and among chordates, or are different 
      strategies used by representatives of the different taxonomic groups? The current 
      state of our knowledge indicates that the immune system of lower chordates is very 
      different from that of cartilaginous fishes. Pure homology hunting for 
      vertebrate-specific immuno-relevant molecules in invertebrates is therefore of 
      limited value. A more promising approach may involve unbiased functional screening 
      methods. To understand better the evolution of adaptive immune systems, more 
      comparative data from jawless vertebrates (lamprey or hagfish) and a representative 
      of Acrania (e.g. Amphioxus) are clearly needed.

AB  - The cold-adapted Rhodococcus sp. strain AW25M09 was isolated from an Atlantic 
      hagfish caught off the shore of northern Norway as part of an ongoing bioprospecting 
      project that aims to identify novel bacteria with biotechnological potential. Here, 
      we present the 5.8-Mb draft genome sequence, together with details regarding the 
      origin of the strain and its sequence assembly.

TI  - Palaeobiology: calcification of early vertebrate cartilage.
PG  - 609
AB  - Hagfish and lampreys are unusual for modern vertebrates in that they have no jaws 
      and their skeletons are neither calcified nor strengthened by collagen the 
      cartilaginous elements of their endoskeleton are composed of huge, clumped 
      chondrocytes (cartilage cells). We have discovered that the cartilage in a 
      370-million-year-old jawless fish, Euphanerops longaevus, was extensively calcified, 
      even though its cellular organization was similar to the non-mineralized type found 
      in lampreys. The calcification of this early lamprey-type cartilage differs from 
      that seen in modern jawed vertebrates, and may represent a parallel evolutionary 
      move towards a mineralized endoskeleton.

PG  - 14304-8
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1001910107 [doi]
AB  - Jawless vertebrates such as lamprey and hagfish lack T-cell and B-cell receptors; 
      instead, they have unique antigen receptors known as variable lymphocyte receptors 
      (VLRs). VLRs generate diversity by recombining highly diverse leucine-rich repeat 
      modules and are expressed clonally on lymphocyte-like cells (LLCs). Thus far, two 
      types of receptors, VLRA and VLRB, have been identified in lampreys and hagfish. 
      Recent evidence indicates that VLRA and VLRB are expressed on distinct populations 
      of LLCs that resemble T cells and B cells of jawed vertebrates, respectively. Here 
      we identified a third VLR, designated VLRC, in the lamprey. None of the 
      approximately 100 VLRC cDNA clones subjected to sequencing had an identical 
      sequence, indicating that VLRC can generate sufficient diversity to function as 
      antigen receptors. Notably, the C-terminal cap of VLRC exhibits only limited 
      diversity and has important structural differences relative to VLRA and VLRB. 
      Single-cell PCR analysis identified LLCs that rearranged VLRC but not VLRA or VLRB, 
      suggesting the presence of a unique population of LLCs that express only VLRC.

TI  - Bacterial stimulation upregulates the surface expression of the stress protein gp96 
      on B cells in the frog Xenopus.
PG  - 265-71
AB  - The presence of the soluble intracellular heat shock protein gp96 (an endoplasmic 
      reticulum resident protein) at the surface of certain cell types is an intriguing 
      phenomenon whose physiological significance has been unclear. We have shown that the 
      active surface expression of gp96 by some immune cells is found throughout the 
      vertebrate phylum including the Agnatha, the only vertebrate taxon whose members 
      (lamprey, hagfish) lack an adaptive immune system. To determine whether gp96 surface 
      expression can be modulated by pathogens, we investigated the effects of in vitro 
      stimulation by purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the heat-killed gram-negative 
      bacteria, Escherichia coli and Aeromonas hydrophilia. Purified Xenopus B cells are 
      readily activated and markedly proliferate in vitro in response to the heat-killed 
      bacteria but not to purified LPS. Furthermore, messenger ribonucleic acid, and 
      intracellular and surface protein expressions of both gp96 and immunoglobulin were 
      upregulated only after activation of B cells by heat-killed bacteria. These data are 
      consistent with an ancestral immunological role of gp96 as an antigen-presenting or 
      danger-signaling molecule, or both, interacting directly with antigen-presenting 
      cells, T cells, or natural killer cells, (or all), to trigger or amplify immune 
      responses.

      alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit 
      genes.
PG  - 690-702
AB  - The AMPA receptor (AMPAR), a pharmacologically defined ionotropic glutamate 
      receptor, mediates fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the vertebrate central 
      nervous system. Mammalian and avian AMPARs are assembled from the products of four 
      genes (GRIA1-GRIA4) conserved in their translated sequences and gene organizations. 
      Teleost fish also express AMPAR subunits; however, the AMPAR genes have not been 
      extensively investigated in lower vertebrates. To elucidate the evolution of 
      vertebrate AMPAR genes, reverse-transcriptase PCR-based surveys of subunits 
      expressed in the brains of eight nonmammalian vertebrates were performed. The newly 
      cloned vertebrate AMPAR subunits were classified by their sequence identities to the 
      mammalian AMPAR subunits. The results of molecular and phylogenetic analyses 
      indicated that the members of the AMPAR gene family increased from two in the 
      jawless hagfish to four in the tetrapods and the shark and to more than four in the 
      teleost fish. The sizes of AMPAR gene families correlate well with those of many 
      multigene families observed in various vertebrates. Moreover, all vertebrates 
      expressed at least one AMPAR subunit bearing an arginine (R) at the Q/R site, at 
      which no invertebrate glutamate receptor subunit has been found to have an R 
      residue, suggesting that the low calcium-permeable AMPARs appeared at early 
      evolutionary stages of vertebrate central nervous systems. Uniquely, the loop 1 (L1) 
      regions between hydrophobic domain 1 and hydrophobic domain 2 of the hagfish 
      putative GRIA2 and all the teleost GRIA1 subunits were much longer than those of the 
      remaining known ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits. The length and sequence of 
      the L1 of teleost GRIA1 subunits were heterogeneous, suggesting that the amino acid 
      residues in L1 were not highly selected.

TI  - Gene cooption and convergent evolution of oxygen transport hemoglobins in jawed and

AB  - Natural selection often promotes evolutionary innovation by coopting preexisting 
      genes for new functions, and this process may be greatly facilitated by gene 
      duplication. Here we report an example of cooptive convergence where paralogous 
      members of the globin gene superfamily independently evolved a specialized O(2) 
      transport function in the two deepest branches of the vertebrate family tree. 
      Specifically, phylogenetic evidence demonstrates that erythroid-specific O(2) 
      transport hemoglobins evolved independently from different ancestral precursor 
      proteins in jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) and jawless fish (cyclostomes, 
      represented by lamprey and hagfish). A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the 
      vertebrate globin gene superfamily revealed that the erythroid hemoglobins of 
      cyclostomes are orthologous to the cytoglobin protein of gnathostome vertebrates, a 
      hexacoordinate globin that has no O(2) transport function and that is predominantly 
      expressed in fibroblasts and related cell types. The phylogeny reconstruction also 
      revealed that vertebrate-specific globins are grouped into four main clades: (i) 
      cyclostome hemoglobin + cytoglobin, (ii) myoglobin + globin E, (iii) globin Y, and 
      (iv) the alpha- and beta-chain hemoglobins of gnathostomes. In the hemoglobins of 
      gnathostomes and cyclostomes, multisubunit quaternary structures provide the basis 
      for cooperative O(2) binding and allosteric regulation by coupling the effects of 
      ligand binding at individual subunits with interactions between subunits. However, 
      differences in numerous structural details belie their independent origins. This 
      example of convergent evolution of protein function provides an impressive 
      demonstration of the ability of natural selection to cobble together complex design 
      solutions by tinkering with different variations of the same basic protein scaffold.

TI  - Analysis of polysulfated chondroitin disaccharides by high-performance liquid 
      chromatography.
PG  - 291-300
AB  - A high-performance liquid chromatography method for analyzing disaccharides derived 
      from chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans has been developed which employs a 
      Whatman Partisil-10 PAC amino-cyano column and an acetonitrile/methanol/ammonium 
      acetate solvent to resolve disulfated, monosulfated, and unsulfated disaccharides in 
      a chromatographic run of less than 20 min. The single known trisulfated chrondroitin 
      disaccharide can be eluted in an alternate solvent system containing the same mobile 
      phase components in different proportions. Disaccharides were prepared for 
      chromatography from glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans of known compositions by 
      digestion with chondroitinase ABC, with the exception of king crab cartilage 
      glycosaminoglycan which was incubated sequentially with hyaluronidase and 
      chondroitinase ABC. Disaccharides were extracted from the digestion mixtures in 80% 
      ethanol, dried over nitrogen, resuspended in the HPLC solvent, and chromatographed 
      at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Unsaturated disaccharides in the column eluate were 
      detected by continuous ultraviolet absorbance monitoring at 232 nm; alternatively, 
      fractions were collected and assayed for uronic acid content or radioactivity. By 
      utilizing the HPLC technique in conjunction with chondroitinase ABC and AC digestion 
      and sulfatase hydrolysis, the epimeric structures of chondroitin sulfates E and H 
      were confirmed. With this technique, rapid and reproducible analyses of chondroitin 
      sulfate disaccharides generated from mouse mast cell proteoglycan and from 
      glycosaminoglycans of squid cranial cartilage, shark skin, hagfish skin, and hagfish 
      notocord were in close agreement with compositions obtained by other techniques.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The characterization of a completely novel adaptive immune system (AIS) 
      in jawless vertebrates (hagfish and lampreys) presents an excellent opportunity for 
      exploring similarities and differences in design principles. It also highlights a 
      somewhat neglected question: Why did vertebrates, representing only 5 % of all 
      animals, evolve a system as complex as an AIS twice, whereas invertebrates failed to 
      do so? A number of theories have been presented in answer to this question. However, 
      these theories either fail to explain why invertebrates would not similarly develop 
      an AIS and are confounded by issues of causality, or have been challenged by more 
      recent findings. PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: Instead of identifying a selective 
      pressure that would drive the development of an AIS, we hypothesise that 
      invertebrates failed to develop an AIS because of the evolutionary constraints 
      imposed by these animals' physiological context. In particular, we argue that a 
      number of vascular innovations in vertebrates allowed the effective implementation 
      of an AIS. A lower blood volume allowed for a higher antibody titer (i.e., less 
      'diluted' antibody concentration), rendering these immune effectors more 
      cost-effective. In addition, both a high circulatory velocity and the ability of 
      endothelium to coordinate immune cell trafficking promote 'epitope sampling'. 
      Collectively, these innovations allowed the effective implementation of AIS in 
      vertebrates. TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: The hypothesis posits that a number of 
      innovations to the vascular system provided the release from constraints which 
      allowed the implementation of an AIS. However, this hypothesis would be refuted by 
      phylogenetic analysis demonstrating that the AIS preceded these vascular 
      innovations. The hypothesis also suggests that vascular performance would have an 
      impact on the efficacy of an AIS, thus predicting a correlation between the vascular 
      parameters of a species and its relative investment in AIS. The contribution of 
      certain vascular innovations in augmenting immune functionality of an AIS can be 
      tested by modelling the effect of different vascular parameters on AIS efficacy. 
      IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS: The hypothesis not only explains the immunological 
      dimorphism between vertebrates and invertebrates but also brings to attention the 
      fact that immunity is dependent on more than just an immune system.

TI  - Characterization of substance P-like immunoreactivity in submammalian species by 
      high performance liquid chromatography.
PG  - 231-6
AB  - Substance P-like immunoreactivity (SP-LI) as measured by RIA was found to be present 
      in a variety of submammalian species and invertebrates. We analyzed this SP-LI in 
      extracts from submammalian species by high performance liquid chromatography. The 
      following species were investigated for the presence of SP-LI (RIA) which was 
      further characterized by subsequent HPLC (investigated areas in parentheses): 
      Hagfish (brain plus spinal cord), (brain, intestine, skin), frog (brain, intestine), 
      turtle (brain, intestine), lizard (brain, intestine, skin) and mouse (spinal cord). 
      RIA alone was performed in extracts from branchiostoma and cricket. The 
      concentrations of SP-LI in brain, spinal cord and intestine of different 
      submammalian species except branchiostoma brain and intestine and turtle brain, were 
      in a similar range (2.1-5.3 fmol/mg in the brain, 0.2-2.0 fmol/mg in the spinal 
      cord, 0.3-4.2 fmol/mg in the intestine). In the turtle brain, extremely high SP-LI 
      concentrations (210 fmol/mg) were found, whereas brain and intestine of 
      branchiostoma contained very little SP-LI (0.1 fmol/mg). In the skin of different 
      species, SP-LI concentrations varied from 0.04 fmol/mg (trout) to 2.0 fmol/mg 
      (lizard). In the cricket, high SP-LI concentrations were found in the cerebral 
      ganglion (15 fmol/mg protein) and in the subesophageal ganglion (27 fmol/mg 
      protein). HPLC analysis of extracts showed that all tissues investigated contained a 
      substance which co-eluted with synthetic SP, and in most tissues a peak was present 
      which co-eluted with SP sulfoxide. Only in mouse spinal cord, trout brain and 
      hagfish brain were these the only peaks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - [Fridtjof Nansen as a neurobiologist].
PG  - 210-1
AB  - Fridtjof Nansen (1861-1930) started his four-year research carrier in neurobiology 
      at the Museum in Bergen in 1882. His PhD thesis from 1886 describes the structure of 
      the nervous system in selected groups of invertebrates and in Amphioxus and the 
      hagfish. For his time, he was a firm antireticularist and is still recognised as a 
      forerunner of the emerging neurone doctrine of contiguity and no continuity between 
      neurons in neural pathways.

AB  - The current state of knowledge about regulatory peptides in endocrine cells and 
      nerves of the alimentary canal of lampreys and hagfishes is reviewed. Cyclostomes 
      have a wide range of peptides similar immunochemically to those of higher 
      vertebrates. They include, in the endocrine cells of the intestine, peptides 
      resembling glucagon, gastrin/cholecystokinin, peptide YY (pancreatic 
      polypeptide/neuropeptide Y), substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide, 
      somatostatin and, in the larval stages at least, insulin. The enteric nerves of some 
      lamprey species contain peptides resembling bombesin (gastrin-releasing peptide) and 
      calcitonin gene-related peptide, as well as serotonin. The occurrence of other 
      peptides is less well documented.Little is known of the molecular structure or the 
      biological roles of the enteric peptides in cyclostomes. Extraction, purification, 
      sequencing and physiological experiments are greatly needed.

AB  - The Drosophila melanogaster developmental gene engrailed (en) is a member of a 
      distinct subfamily of homeobox genes with a wide phylogenetic distribution. Here we 
      report the use of reduced stringency polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify and 
      clone 8 genes related to en from 5 vertebrate species, including representatives of 
      the most ancient vertebrate lineages. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence 
      comparisons between mouse, toad, zebrafish, lamprey and hagfish genes reveal 
      extensive evolutionary conservation, and suggests that 2 en-like genes have been 
      retained in most vertebrate lineages.

PG  - 1061-3
AB  - 1. Preliminary spectroscopic examination of a second component of hagfish bile salts 
      suggested that it might be 3beta,7alpha,26(27)-trihydroxy-5alpha-cholestane. 2. 
      Impure reduction products of the 3beta,26(27)-dihydroxycholestane-7,16-dione 
      previously made from myxinol disulphate appeared also to have the 
      5alpha-configuration. 3. Infrared, nuclear-magnetic-resonance and 
      mass-spectrographic as well as optical-rotatory-dispersion measurements on 
      3beta,26(27)-dihydroxycholestane-7,16-dione showed that it was a 5alpha-compound. 4. 
      Myxinol is thus 3beta,7alpha,16alpha,26(27)-tetrahydroxy-5alpha-cholestane; new 
      nuclear-magnetic-resonance measurements on myxinol tetra-acetate at higher 
      resolution confirm this structure.

PG  - 185-96
LID - 10.1007/s00239-008-9074-8 [doi]
AB  - Mammalian blood clotting involves numerous components, most of which are the result 
      of gene duplications that occurred early in vertebrate evolution and after the 
      divergence of protochordates. As such, the genomes of the jawless fish (hagfish and 
      lamprey) offer the best possibility for finding systems that might have a reduced 
      set of the many clotting factors observed in higher vertebrates. The most 
      straightforward way of inventorying these factors may be through whole genome 
      sequencing. In this regard, the NCBI Trace database ( 
      http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi ) for the lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) 
      contains more than 18 million raw DNA sequences determined by whole-genome shotgun 
      methodology. The data are estimated to be about sixfold redundant, indicating that 
      coverage is sufficiently complete to permit judgments about the presence or absence 
      of particular genes. A search for 20 proteins whose sequences were determined prior 
      to the trace database study found all 20. A subsequent search for specified 
      coagulation factors revealed a lamprey system with a smaller number of components 
      than is found in other vertebrates in that factors V and VIII seem to be represented 
      by a single gene, and factor IX, which is ordinarily a cofactor of factor VIII, is 
      not present. Fortuitously, after the completion of the survey of the Trace database, 
      a draft assembly based on the same database was posted. The draft assembly allowed 
      many of the identified Trace fragments to be linked into longer sequences that fully 
      support the conclusion that lampreys have a simpler clotting scheme compared with 
      other vertebrates. The data are also consistent with the hypothesis that a 
      whole-genome duplication or other large scale block duplication occurred after the 
      divergence of jawless fish from other vertebrates and allowed the simultaneous 
      appearance of a second set of two functionally paired proteins in the vertebrate 
      clotting scheme.

      several mammalian tissues, other animals such as starfish, lingula and hagfish, and 
      wheat germ. Q isolated from rat liver tRNA was found to be identical with E. coli Q 
      by mass spectrometry and thin-layer chromatography. Thus the rare modified 
      nucleoside Q originally isolated from E. coli tRNA, is widely distributed in various 
      organisms. Analysis of the mass spectrum of Q* suggested that it has a different 
      side chain from Q.

TI  - Vertebrate phylogeny of hydrogen sulfide vasoactivity.
PG  - R243-52
AB  - Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is a recently identified endogenous vasodilator in mammals. 
      In steelhead/rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss, Osteichthyes), H(2)S produces both 
      dose-dependent dilation and a unique dose-dependent constriction. In this study, we 
      examined H(2)S vasoactivity in all vertebrate classes to determine whether H(2)S is 
      universally vasoactive and to identify phylogenetic and/or environmental trends. 
      H(2)S was generated from NaHS and examined in unstimulated and precontracted 
      systemic and, when applicable, pulmonary arteries (PA) from Pacific hagfish 
      (Eptatretus stouti, Agnatha), sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus, Agnatha), sandbar 
      shark (Carcharhinus milberti, Chondrichthyes), marine toad (Bufo marinus, Amphibia), 
      American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis, Reptilia), Pekin duck (Anas 
      platyrhynchos domesticus, Aves), and white rat (Rattus rattus, Mammalia). In 
      otherwise unstimulated vessels, NaHS produced 1) a dose-dependent relaxation in 
      Pacific hagfish dorsal aorta; 2) a dose-dependent contraction in sea lamprey dorsal 
      aorta, marine toad aorta, alligator aorta and PA, duck aorta, and rat thoracic 
      aorta; 3) a threshold relaxation in shark ventral aorta, dorsal aorta, and afferent 
      branchial artery; and 4) a multiphasic contraction-relaxation-contraction in the 
      marine toad PA, duck PA, and rat PA. Precontraction of these vessels with another 
      agonist did not affect the general pattern of NaHS vasoactivity with the exception 
      of the rat aorta, where relaxation was now dominant. These results show that H(2)S 
      is a phylogenetically ancient and versatile vasoregulatory molecule that appears to 
      have been opportunistically engaged to suit both organ-specific and species-specific 
      homeostatic requirements.

TI  - Evidence for a single median fin-fold and tail in the Lower Cambrian vertebrate, 
      Haikouichthys ercaicunensis.
PG  - 1162-6
AB  - In this study, we illustrate an exceptionally well-preserved Haikouichthys 
      ercaicunensis from the Lower Cambrian Chengjiang fauna that displays complete single 
      dorsal, ventral and caudal fins. This 530-million-year old vertebrate is fish-shaped 
      and characterized by a single median fin-fold, which is an essential trait of the 
      initial vertebrate chordates. The radially orientated ray-like structures in its 
      dorsal fin somewhat resemble but are probably not real radials seen in basal 
      vertebrates, such as hagfishes and lampreys. The unique design of primitive fins and 
      fin structures provides additional insights into the early evolution of vertebrates.

TI  - Temporal control of DNA replication and the adaptive value of chromatin diminution 
      in copepods.
PG  - 310-6
AB  - Chromatin diminution is a precisely controlled, highly repeatable, genome-wide 
      deletion of noncoding heterochromatic segments from the presomatic line. The somatic 
      line is reduced in size and reorganized; the germ line remains unaltered. Little is 
      understood about its mechanistic underpinnings and adaptive significance in the 
      nematodes, copepods, and hagfish in which it occurs. Here, we propose that 
      microcrustacean copepods, whose cytology, development, and evolutionary ecology are 
      well understood from an adaptationist point of view, provide the vehicle to test how 
      chromatin diminution might orchestrate certain cell cycle dynamics, with the 
      consequence of influencing the evolution of nuclear DNA contents, organismal 
      development rates, and body size.

TI  - The primary structure of the hemoglobins of a southern hemisphere lamprey (Mordacia 
      mordax, Cyclostomata).
PG  - 49-56
AB  - Mordacia mordax is a southern hemisphere lamprey belonging to Mordaciidae, a 
      primitive family of Cyclostomata. Adult erythrocytes contain three monomeric 
      hemoglobins which can be easily separated by cellulose acetate electrophoresis and 
      isolated by ion-exchange chromatography. The N-terminal regions, and the tryptic 
      peptides from each chain were submitted to automated Edman degradation; the 
      alignment of the fragments was obtained by homology with the other Petromyzonoidea 
      hemoglobins hitherto sequenced. Our results confirm the phylogenic distance between 
      lampreys and hag-fish hemoglobins. As was observed for Petromyzon marinus species, 
      two hemoglobins of Mordacia mordax are very close, as they differ only at 7 
      positions.

TI  - Agnathan VIP, PACAP and their receptors: ancestral origins of today's highly 
      diversified forms.
PG  - e44691
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0044691 [doi]
LID - e44691
AB  - VIP and PACAP are pleiotropic peptides belonging to the secretin superfamily of 
      brain-gut peptides and interact specifically with three receptors (VPAC(1), PAC(1) 
      and VPAC(2)) from the class II B G protein-coupled receptor family. There is immense 
      interest regarding their molecular evolution which is often described closely 
      alongside gene and/or genome duplications. Despite the wide array of information 
      available in various vertebrates and one invertebrate the tunicate, their 
      evolutionary origins remain unresolved. Through searches of genome databases and 
      molecular cloning techniques, the first lamprey VIP/PACAP ligands and VPAC receptors 
      are identified from the Japanese lamprey. In addition, two VPAC receptors (VPACa/b) 
      are identified from inshore hagfish and ligands predicted for sea lamprey. 
      Phylogenetic analyses group these molecules into their respective PHI/VIP, PRP/PACAP 
      and VPAC receptor families and show they resemble ancestral forms. Japanese lamprey 
      VIP/PACAP peptides synthesized were tested with the hagfish VPAC receptors. hfVPACa 
      transduces signal via both adenylyl cylase and phospholipase C pathways, whilst 
      hfVPACb was only able to transduce through the calcium pathway. In contrast to the 
      widespread distribution of VIP/PACAP ligands and receptors in many species, the 
      agnathan PACAP and VPAC receptors were found almost exclusively in the brain. In 
      situ hybridisation further showed their abundance throughout the brain. The range of 
      VIP/PACAP ligands and receptors found are highly useful, providing a glimpse into 
      the evolutionary events both at the structural and functional levels. Though 
      representative of ancestral forms, the VIP/PACAP ligands in particular have retained 
      high sequence conservation indicating the importance of their functions even early 
      in vertebrate evolution. During these nascent stages, only two VPAC receptors are 
      likely responsible for eliciting functions before evolving later into specific 
      subtypes post-Agnatha. We also propose VIP and PACAP's first functions to 
      predominate in the brain, evolving alongside the central nervous system, 
      subsequently establishing peripheral functions.

      Immunization with particulate antigens induces VLR-B-bearing lymphocytes to secrete 
      antigen-specific VLR-B antibodies. Here, we describe the production of recombinant 
      VLR-B antibodies specific for BclA, a major coat protein of Bacillus anthracis 
      spores. The recombinant VLR-B antibodies possess 8-10 uniform subunits that 
      collectively bind antigen with high avidity. Sequence analysis, mutagenesis, and 
      modeling studies show that antigen binding involves residues in the beta-sheets 
      lining the VLR-B concave surface. EM visualization reveals tetrameric and pentameric 
      molecules having a central core and highly flexible pairs of stalk-region "arms" 
      with antigen-binding "hands." Remarkable antigen-binding specificity, avidity, and 
      stability predict that these unusual LRR-based monoclonal antibodies will find many 
      biomedical uses.

PG  - 1932-9
AB  - TBP functions in transcription initiation in all eukaryotes and in Archaebacteria. 
      Although the 181-amino acid (aa) carboxyl (C-) terminal core of the protein is 
      highly conserved, TBP proteins from different phyla exhibit diverse sequences in 
      their amino (N-) terminal region. In mice, the TBP N-terminus plays a role in 
      protecting the placenta from maternal rejection; however the presence of similar TBP 
      N-termini in nontherian tetrapods suggests that this domain also has more primitive 
      functions. To gain insights into the pretherian functions of the N-terminus, we 
      investigated its phylogenetic distribution. TBP cDNAs were isolated from 
      representative nontetrapod jawed vertebrates (zebrafish and shark), from more 
      primitive jawless vertebrates (lamprey and hagfish), and from a prevertebrate 
      cephalochordate (amphioxus). Results showed that the tetrapod N-terminus likely 
      arose coincident with the earliest vertebrates. The primary structures of vertebrate 
      N-termini indicates that, historically, this domain has undergone events involving 
      intragenic duplication and modification of short oligopeptide-encoding DNA 
      sequences, which might have provided a mechanism of de novo evolution of this 
      polypeptide.

AB  - Lampreys are a group of aquatic chordates whose relationships to hagfishes and jawed 
      vertebrates are still debated. Lamprey embryology is of interest to evolutionary 
      biologists because it may shed light on vertebrate origins. For this and other 
      reasons, lamprey embryology has been extensively researched by biologists from a 
      range of disciplines. However, many of the key studies of lamprey comparative 
      embryology are relatively inaccessible to the modern scientist. Therefore, in view 
      of the current resurgence of interest in lamprey evolution and development, we 
      present here a review of lamprey developmental anatomy. We identify several features 
      of early organogenesis, including the origin of the nephric duct, that need to be 
      re-examined with modern techniques. The homologies of several structures are also 
      unclear, including the intriguing subendothelial pads in the heart. We hope that 
      this review will form the basis for future studies into the phylogenetic embryology 
      of this interesting group of animals.

TI  - The ancestral complement system in sea urchins.
PG  - 16-34
AB  - The origin of adaptive immunity in the vertebrates can be traced to the appearance 
      of the ancestral RAG genes in the ancestral jawed vertebrate; however, the innate 
      immune system is more ancient. A central subsystem within innate immunity is the 
      complement system, which has been identified throughout and seems to be restricted 
      to the deuterostomes. The evolutionary history of complement can be traced from the 
      sea urchins (members of the echinoderm phylum), which have a simplified system 
      homologous to the alternative pathway, through the agnathans (hagfish and lamprey) 
      and the elasmobranchs (sharks and rays) to the teleosts (bony fish) and tetrapods, 
      with increases in the numbers of complement components and duplications in 
      complement pathways. Increasing complexity in the complement system parallels 
      increasing complexity in the deuterostome animals. This review focuses on the 
      simplest of the complement systems that is present in the sea urchin. Two components 
      have been identified that show significant homology to vertebrate C3 and factor B 
      (Bf), called SpC3 and SpBf, respectively. Sequence analysis from both molecules 
      reveals their ancestral characteristics. Immune challenge of sea urchins indicates 
      that SpC3 is inducible and is present in coelomic fluid (the body fluids) in 
      relatively high concentrations, while SpBf expression is constitutive and is present 
      in much lower concentrations. Opsonization of foreign cells and particles followed 
      by augmented uptake by phagocytic coelomocytes appears to be a central function for 
      this simpler complement system and important for host defense in the sea urchin. 
      These activities are similar to some of the functions of the homologous proteins in 
      the vertebrate complement system. The selective advantage for the ancestral 
      deuterostome may have been the amplification feedback loop that is still of central 
      importance in the alternative pathway of complement in higher vertebrates. Feedback 
      loop functions would quickly coat pathogens with complement leading to phagocytosis 
      and removal of foreign cells, a system that would be significantly more effective 
      than an opsonin that binds upon contact as a result of simple diffusion. An 
      understanding of the immune response of the sea urchin, an animal that is a good 
      estimator of what the ancestral deuterostome immune system was like, will aid us in 
      understanding how adaptive immunity might have been selected for during the early 
      evolution of the vertebrates and how it might have been integrated into the 
      pre-existing innate immune system that was already in place in those animals.

PG  - 200330

LID - 200330
AB  - Vertebrates develop an olfactory system that detects odorants and pheromones through 
      their interaction with specialized cell surface receptors on olfactory sensory 
      neurons. During development, the olfactory system forms from the olfactory placodes, 
      specialized areas of the anterior ectoderm that share cellular and molecular 
      properties with placodes involved in the development of other cranial senses. The 
      early-diverging chordate lineages amphioxus, tunicates, lampreys and hagfishes give 
      insight into how this system evolved. Here, we review olfactory system development 
      and cell types in these lineages alongside chemosensory receptor gene evolution, 
      integrating these data into a description of how the vertebrate olfactory system 
      evolved. Some olfactory system cell types predate the vertebrates, as do some of the 
      mechanisms specifying placodes, and it is likely these two were already connected in 
      the common ancestor of vertebrates and tunicates. In stem vertebrates, this evolved 
      into an organ system integrating additional tissues and morphogenetic processes 
      defining distinct olfactory and adenohypophyseal components, followed by splitting 
      of the ancestral placode to produce the characteristic paired olfactory organs of 
      most modern vertebrates.

TI  - Fossil jawless fish from China foreshadows early jawed vertebrate anatomy.
PG  - 324-7
LID - 10.1038/nature10276 [doi]
AB  - Most living vertebrates are jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes), and the living jawless 
      vertebrates (cyclostomes), hagfishes and lampreys, provide scarce information about 
      the profound reorganization of the vertebrate skull during the evolutionary origin 
      of jaws. The extinct bony jawless vertebrates, or 'ostracoderms', are regarded as 
      precursors of jawed vertebrates and provide insight into this formative episode in 
      vertebrate evolution. Here, using synchrotron radiation X-ray tomography, we 
      describe the cranial anatomy of galeaspids, a 435-370-million-year-old 'ostracoderm' 
      group from China and Vietnam. The paired nasal sacs of galeaspids are located 
      anterolaterally in the braincase, and the hypophyseal duct opens anteriorly towards 
      the oral cavity. These three structures (the paired nasal sacs and the hypophyseal 
      duct) were thus already independent of each other, like in gnathostomes and unlike 
      in cyclostomes and osteostracans (another 'ostracoderm' group), and therefore have 
      the condition that current developmental models regard as prerequisites for the 
      development of jaws. This indicates that the reorganization of vertebrate cranial 
      anatomy was not driven deterministically by the evolutionary origin of jaws but 
      occurred stepwise, ultimately allowing the rostral growth of ectomesenchyme that now 
      characterizes gnathostome head development.

TI  - Autonomic control of circulation in fish: a comparative view.
PG  - 127-39
LID - 10.1016/j.autneu.2011.08.006 [doi]
AB  - The autonomic nervous system has a central role in the control and co-ordination of 
      the cardiovascular system in all vertebrates. In fish, which represent the largest 
      and most diverse vertebrate group, the autonomic control of the circulation displays 
      a vast variation with a number of interesting deviations from the typical vertebrate 
      pattern. This diversity ranges from virtually no known nervous control of the 
      circulation in hagfish, to a fully developed dual control from both cholinergic and 
      adrenergic nerves in teleost, much resembling the situation found in other 
      vertebrate groups. This review summarizes current knowledge on the role of the 
      autonomic nervous system in the control of the cardiovascular system in fish. We set 
      out by providing an overview of the general trends and patterns in the major fish 
      groups, and then a summary of how the autonomic nervous control is involved in 
      normal daily activities such as barostatic control of blood pressure, as well as 
      adjustments of the cardiovascular system during feeding and environmental hypoxia.

TI  - Fish hemoglobins.
PG  - 769-78
AB  - Vertebrate hemoglobin, contained in erythrocytes, is a globular protein with a 
      quaternary structure composed of 4 globin chains (2 alpha and 2 beta) and a 
      prosthetic group named heme bound to each one. Having myoglobin as an ancestor, 
      hemoglobin acquired the capacity to respond to chemical stimuli that modulate its 
      function according to tissue requirements for oxygen. Fish are generally submitted 
      to spatial and temporal O2 variations and have developed anatomical, physiological 
      and biochemical strategies to adapt to the changing environmental gas availability. 
      Structurally, most fish hemoglobins are tetrameric; however, those from some species 
      such as lamprey and hagfish dissociate, being monomeric when oxygenated and 
      oligomeric when deoxygenated. Fish blood frequently possesses several hemoglobins; 
      the primary origin of this finding lies in the polymorphism that occurs in the 
      globin loci, an aspect that may occasionally confer advantages to its carriers or 
      even be a harmless evolutionary remnant. On the other hand, the functional 
      properties exhibit different behaviors, ranging from a total absence of responses to 
      allosteric regulation to drastic ones, such as the Root effect.

TI  - Circulatory catecholamines in the eel: origins and functions.
PG  - 273-8
LID - 10.1007/BF00004717 [doi]
AB  - While the three catecholamines (CAs) dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE) and 
      epinephrine (E), are wide-spread in tissues of the American eel (Anguilla rostrata), 
      the bulk of these CAs in the systemic blood originates from chromaffin cells in the 
      wall of the posterior cardinal veins. In addition, the brain and unidentified 
      structures in the opisthonephric kidney also release appreciable quantities of CAs. 
      The functional realms attributed to systematically circulating CAs in teleosts 
      comprise cardiovascular, respiratory, osmoregulatory, metabolic and endocrinotropic 
      actions. In the eel, cardiovascular and respiratory effects are well established. 
      However, we were unable to prove a physiological role of the CAs in osmoregulation. 
      On the other hand, the eel is the only species among five vertebrates of greatly 
      varying phylogenetic position (the others: hagfish, lamprey, rat, human) in which 
      physiological doses of E were hyperglycemic. As in lamprey and rat, DA and NE are 
      released in the eel by physiological doses of E. In addition, DA and NE also release 
      the respective other two CAs. The physiological significance of the 
      catecholaminotropic (CA-tropic) interactions remains to be established; however, the 
      CA-tropic effect of E does not require the presence of the brain or 'preganglionic' 
      nerve cells. In the eel, mild stress causes an immediate 'unorthodox' drop of plasma 
      CAs, while stronger stress is followed by the expected increase of plasma CAs.

TI  - Chromatin elimination--an oddity or a common mechanism in differentiation and 
      development?
PG  - 84-91
AB  - Over many decades, a great number of exceptions from the rule of equal segregation 
      of the chromosomes during cell division have been found in different animal species. 
      The most diversified is the process of chromosome re-arrangement that takes place 
      during the specification of soma versus germ-line cell fate in the embryos from the 
      whole spectrum of animal phyla. In nematodes, copepodes, insects, hagfish, and 
      marsupials, the chromatin/chromosome elimination is a common path of normal cell 
      differentiation and development. This also raises the question of the mechanisms and 
      factors that promote elimination in pre-somatic cell lines and/or inhibit the 
      elimination in the prospective germ cells. We will discuss the possible role of the 
      germ plasm in this process.

TI  - Molecular evolution of the natriuretic peptide system as revealed by comparative 
      genomics.
PG  - 69-76
LID - 10.1016/j.cbd.2005.10.002 [doi]
AB  - The natriuretic peptide (NP) family is a group of peptides involved in 
      cardiovascular and body fluid regulation in vertebrates. While only C-type NP (CNP) 
      has been found in elasmobranchs, atrial NP (ANP), B-type NP (BNP) and CNP have been 
      found in mammals, and ventricular NP (VNP) instead of BNP in teleosts. Thus, it was 
      once hypothesized that CNP is the ancestral NP, from which ANP and BNP/VNP were 
      generated. However, the discovery of hfNP in the hagfish, and CNP in the lamprey 
      suggested that the ancestral NP had characteristics common to these two peptides. 
      Genomic studies in ray-finned fish revealed multiplication processes of NP genes: 
      The ancestral gene was duplicated into four CNP genes before the divergence of 
      elasmobranchs, and ANP, BNP and VNP genes were generated from one of the four CNP 
      genes by tandem duplications. From up to seven NP genes thus generated, tetrapods 
      are supposed to have lost some of them. Concerning NP receptors, teleosts also have 
      more subtypes (three guanylyl cyclase-coupled receptors and two clearance receptors) 
      than mammals. It is of interest to examine how the complicated NP system in teleosts 
      compared with tetrapods, is involved in the adaptation to a wide variety of osmotic 
      environments.

AB  - Cationized ferritin was injected into the circulatory system of teleosts, the sea 
      raven and Atlantic eelpout, and into elasmobranchs, the spiny dogfish and the skate, 
      to determine if the glomerular basement membranes (GBM) from these different groups 
      of fishes possess anionic binding sites similar to those present in the GBM of 
      mammals. The distribution of cationized ferritin was the same in all fishes listed. 
      Cationized ferritin was localized only in the GBM and the mesangial matrix. The 
      regular distribution of cationized ferritin within the laminae rarae (approximately 
      60 nm intervals) was taken as evidence of the presence of anionic binding sites. 
      Cationized ferritin did not bind to the glomerular capillary endothelium, nor was 
      any of it localized at the base of the slit diaphragms of the foot processes of the 
      podocytes. The distribution of binding sites in the GBM of these fishes is similar 
      to that in another teleost, the winter flounder, and in a cyclostome, the hagfish.

      microchemical study in adult and newborn guinea pigs, rats, Chinese hamsters and 
      spiny mice.
PG  - 570-7
AB  - By a flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry procedure, using a graphite 
      furnace, it was possible to assay the contents of zinc and managanese in 
      micro-dissected pancreatic islets of several rodents. Interest was focused upon the 
      islets of guinea-pigs, due to the fact that guinea-pig insulin lacks a histidine 
      residue in the B10 position of the molecule which normally binds zinc (or other 
      heavy metals) in the hexamer formation, probably involved in the storage of insulin. 
      Both the zinc and manganese contents were too low in the guinea-pig islet parenchyma 
      to be reasonably involved in the storage of insulin in the beta-granules. Instead, 
      it was suggested that guinea-pig insulin, like hagfish insulin, might crystallize 
      without access to zinc or other heavy metals. Low zinc and manganese contents were 
      also observed in newborn and diabetic guinea-pigs. The islet zinc content was high 
      in the Wistar rat, the Chinese hamster, and the spiny mouse. No significant amounts 
      of manganese were found in any of these kinds of islet parenchyma.

TI  - Laterality is Universal Among Fishes but Increasingly Cryptic Among Derived Groups.
PG  - 267-274
LID - 10.2108/zs160196 [doi]
AB  - Laterality has been studied in several vertebrates, mainly in terms of brain 
      lateralization and behavioral laterality, but morphological asymmetry has not been 
      extensively investigated. Asymmetry in fishes was first described in scale-eating 
      cichlids from Lake Tanganyika, in the form of bilateral dimorphism in which some 
      individuals, when opening their mouths, twist them to the right and others to the 
      left. This asymmetry has a genetic basis, and is correlated with lateralized attack 
      behaviors. This has subsequently been found in fishes from numerous taxa with 
      various feeding habits. The generality of such morphological laterality should thus 
      be investigated in as wide a range of fishes as possible. Using specific indicators 
      of lateral differences in mandibles and head inclination, we find that 
      representative species from all 60 orders of extant gnathostome fishes (both bony 
      and cartilaginous) possess morphological laterality. Furthermore, we identify the 
      same laterality in agnathans (hagfish and lamprey), suggesting that this trait 
      appeared early in fish evolution and has been maintained across fish lineages. 
      However, a comparison of asymmetry among groups of bony fishes reveals, 
      unexpectedly, that phylogenetically more recent-groups possess less asymmetry in 
      body structures. The universality of laterality in fishes indicates a monophyletic 
      origin, and may have been present in the ancestors of vertebrates. Ecological 
      factors, predator-prey interactions in particular, may be key drivers in the 
      evolution and maintenance of dimorphism, and may also be responsible for the cryptic 
      trend of asymmetry in derived groups. Because lungfish and coelacanths share this 
      trait, it is likely that tetrapods also inherited it. We believe that study of this 
      morphological laterality will provide insights into the behavioral and sensory 
      lateralization of vertebrates.

TI  - An investigation of astroglial morphology in torpedo and scyliorhinus.
PG  - 639-53
AB  - The distribution and morphology of GFAP-immunoreactive cells was investigated in two 
      elasmobranch species, Scyliorhinus canicula and Torpedo marmorata, in an attempt to 
      distinguish between Horstmann's (1954) hypothesis that the presence of cells 
      resembling mammalian astrocytes is a function of the thickness of the ventricular 
      walls, and Cajal's (1911) hypothesis that astrocytes are a phylogenetic novelty 
      found only in birds and mammals. Two types of GFAP-reactive elements were observed, 
      but the distribution of these differed markedly between the two species. In 
      Scyliorhinus, radial glial cells were predominant and astrocytes relatively rare. In 
      Torpedo, on the other hand, a species in which the ventricles are atrophied and the 
      ventricular walls extremely thick, the overwhelming majority of GFAP-labelled 
      structures strongly resembled astrocytes; occasionally, GFAP-positive cells were 
      observed in the ependyma of the spinal cord. These findings, together with previous 
      results obtained by others in hagfish, provide strong evidence in favour of 
      Horstmann's hypothesis.

TI  - Application of hybrid LRR technique to protein crystallization.
PG  - 353-7
AB  - LRR family proteins play important roles in a variety of physiological processes. To 
      facilitate their production and crystallization, we have invented a novel method 
      termed "Hybrid LRR Technique". Using this technique, the first crystal structures of 
      three TLR family proteins could be determined. In this review, design principles and 
      application of the technique to protein crystallization will be summarized. For 
      crystallization of TLRs, hagfish VLR receptors were chosen as the fusion partners 
      and the TLR and the VLR fragments were fused at the conserved LxxLxLxxN motif to 
      minimize local structural incompatibility. TLR-VLR hybridization did not disturb 
      structures and functions of the target TLR proteins. The Hybrid LRR Technique is a 
      general technique that can be applied to structural studies of other LRR proteins. 
      It may also have broader application in biochemical and medical application of LRR 
      proteins by modifying them without compromising their structural integrity.

TI  - Evolution of adrenal and sex steroid action in vertebrates: a ligand-based mechanism 
      for complexity.
PG  - 396-400
AB  - Various explanations have been proposed to account for complex differentiation and 
      development in humans, despite the human genome containing only two to three times 
      the number of genes in invertebrates. Ignored are the actions of adrenal and sex 
      steroids-androgens, estrogens, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and 
      progestins-which act through receptors that arose from an ancestral nuclear receptor 
      in a protochordate. This ligand-based mechanism is unique to vertebrates and was 
      integrated into the already robust network of transcription factors in 
      invertebrates. Adrenal and sex steroids influence almost all aspects of vertebrate 
      differentiation and development. I propose that evolution of this ligand-based 
      mechanism in a primitive vertebrate was an important contribution to vertebrate 
      complexity. Sequencing of genomes from a cephalochordate, such as amphioxus, and 
      from hagfish and lamprey will establish early events in the evolution of steroid 
      hormone signaling, and also allow genetic studies to elucidate how vertebrate 
      complexity depends on steroid hormones.

TI  - Phylogeny of the C3/C4/C5 complement-component gene family indicates that C5 
      diverged first.
PG  - 417-25
AB  - A phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences from the C3/C4/C5 complement-component 
      family of vertebrates supported the hypothesis that the C5 gene diverged first from 
      the common ancestor of C3 and C4 and that C3 and C4 diverged later. The close 
      relationship of C3 and C4 was further supported by the fact that a hagfish 
      complement-component gene showed evidence of being more closely related to both C3 
      and C4 than to C5. This phylogeny is most consistent with the hypothesis that the 
      alternative complement pathway was the first to evolve, followed by the terminal 
      pathway and then by the classical pathway.

TI  - Evolutionary transformations of myoseptal tendons in gnathostomes.
PG  - 1229-35
AB  - Axial undulations in fishes are powered by a series of three-dimensionally folded 
      myomeres separated by sheets of connective tissue, the myosepta. Myosepta have been 
      hypothesized to function as transmitters of muscular forces to axial structures 
      during swimming, but the difficulty of studying these delicate complex structures 
      has precluded a more complete understanding of myoseptal mechanics. We have 
      developed a new combination of techniques for visualizing the three-dimensional 
      morphology of myosepta, and here we present their collagen-fibre architecture based 
      on examination of 62 species representing all of the major clades of notochordates. 
      In all gnathostome fishes, each myoseptum bears a set of six specifically arranged 
      tendons. Because these tendons are not present outside the gnathostomes (i.e. they 
      are absent from lampreys, hagfishes and lancelets), they represent evolutionary 
      novelties of the gnathostome ancestor. This arrangement has remained unchanged 
      throughout 400 Myr of gnathostome evolution, changing only on the transition to 
      land. The high uniformity of myoseptal architecture in gnathostome fishes indicates 
      functional significance and may be a key to understanding general principles of fish 
      swimming mechanics. In the design of future experiments or biomechanical models, 
      myosepta have to be regarded as tendons that can distribute forces in specific 
      directions.

TI  - The evolution of adaptive immune systems.
PG  - 815-22
AB  - A clonally diverse anticipatory repertoire in which each lymphocyte bears a unique 
      antigen receptor is the central feature of the adaptive immune system that evolved 
      in our vertebrate ancestors. The survival advantage gained through adding this type 
      of adaptive immune system to a pre-existing innate immune system led to the 
      evolution of alternative ways for lymphocytes to generate diverse antigen receptors 
      for use in recognizing and repelling pathogen invaders. All jawed vertebrates 
      assemble their antigen-receptor genes through recombinatorial rearrangement of 
      different immunoglobulin or T cell receptor gene segments. The surviving jawless 
      vertebrates, lampreys and hagfish, instead solved the receptor diversification 
      problem by the recombinatorial assembly of leucine-rich-repeat genetic modules to 
      encode variable lymphocyte receptors. The convergent evolution of these remarkably 
      different adaptive immune systems involved innovative genetic modification of 
      innate-immune-system components.

TI  - Update: brain and pituitary hormones of lampreys.
PG  - 291-302
AB  - Lampreys and hagfish of the class Agnatha are of particular importance in 
      understanding endocrinological relationships since they represent the oldest 
      lineages of extant vertebrates which evolved over 550 million years ago. This review 
      briefly summarizes the latest findings on the reproductive endocrinology of the sea 
      lampreys. Since the First International Symposium of Fish Endocrinology in 1988, 
      when virtually little was known of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, 
      substantial new biochemical, molecular, physiological and immunological evidence has 
      now clearly shown that lamprey reproduction is controlled by the neuroendocrine 
      axis. In addition, five brain and six pituitary hormones of lampreys have been 
      identified mainly by Sower and Kawauchi and colleagues between 1986 and 2000. We now 
      hypothesize that lamprey reproduction is a highly synchronized process that is 
      initiated or mediated by a coordination of complex integration of environmental cues 
      and hormonal mechanisms which is broadly similar to that exhibited by gnathostome 
      vertebrates.

TI  - Inferring the "Primordial Immune Complex": Origins of MHC Class I and Antigen 
      Receptors Revealed by Comparative Genomics.
PG  - 1882-1896
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1900597 [doi]
AB  - Comparative analyses suggest that the MHC was derived from a prevertebrate 
      "primordial immune complex" (PIC). PIC duplicated twice in the well-studied two 
      rounds of genome-wide duplications (2R) early in vertebrate evolution, generating 
      four MHC paralogous regions (predominantly on human chromosomes [chr] 1, 6, 9, 19). 
      Examining chiefly the amphibian Xenopus laevis, but also other vertebrates, we 
      identified their MHC paralogues and mapped MHC class I, AgR, and "framework" genes. 
      Most class I genes mapped to MHC paralogues, but a cluster of Xenopus MHC class Ib 
      genes (xnc), which previously was mapped outside of the MHC paralogues, was 
      surrounded by genes syntenic to mammalian CD1 genes, a region previously proposed as 
      an MHC paralogue on human chr 1. Thus, this gene block is instead the result of a 
      translocation that we call the translocated part of the MHC paralogous region 
      (MHCtrans) Analyses of Xenopus class I genes, as well as MHCtrans, suggest that 
      class I arose at 1R on the chr 6/19 ancestor. Of great interest are nonrearranging 
      AgR-like genes mapping to three MHC paralogues; thus, PIC clearly contained several 
      AgR precursor loci, predating MHC class I/II. However, all rearranging AgR genes 
      were found on paralogues derived from the chr 19 precursor, suggesting that invasion 
      of a variable (V) exon by the RAG transposon occurred after 2R. We propose models 
      for the evolutionary history of MHC/TCR/Ig and speculate on the dichotomy between 
      the jawless (lamprey and hagfish) and jawed vertebrate adaptive immune systems, as 
      we found genes related to variable lymphocyte receptors also map to MHC paralogues.

TI  - The importance of a single amino acid substitution in reduced red blood cell 
      carbonic anhydrase function of early-diverging fish.
PG  - 287-296
LID - 10.1007/s00360-020-01270-9 [doi]
AB  - In most vertebrates, red blood cell carbonic anhydrase (RBC CA) plays a critical 
      role in carbon dioxide (CO(2)) transport and excretion across epithelial tissues. 
      Many early-diverging fishes (e.g., hagfish and chondrichthyans) are unique in 
      possessing plasma-accessible membrane-bound CA-IV in the gills, allowing some CO(2) 
      excretion to occur without involvement from the RBCs. However, implications of this 
      on RBC CA function are unclear. Through homology cloning techniques, we identified 
      the putative protein sequences for RBC CA from nine early-diverging species. In all 
      cases, these sequences contained a modification of the proton shuttle residue 
      His-64, and activity measurements from three early-diverging fish demonstrated 
      significantly reduced CA activity. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to restore the 
      His-64 proton shuttle, which significantly increased RBC CA activity, clearly 
      illustrating the functional significance of His-64 in fish red blood cell CA 
      activity. Bayesian analyses of 55 vertebrate cytoplasmic CA isozymes suggested that 
      independent evolutionary events led to the modification of His-64 and thus reduced 
      CA activity in hagfish and chondrichthyans. Additionally, in early-diverging fish 
      that possess branchial CA-IV, there is an absence of His-64 in RBC CAs and the 
      absence of the Root effect [where a reduction in pH reduces hemoglobin's capacity to 
      bind with oxygen (O(2))]. Taken together, these data indicate that low-activity RBC 
      CA may be present in all fish with branchial CA-IV, and that the high-activity RBC 
      CA seen in most teleosts may have evolved in conjunction with enhanced hemoglobin pH 
      sensitivity.

TI  - The Independent Evolution of Dorsal Pallia in Multiple Vertebrate Lineages.
PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.1159/000516563 [doi]
AB  - Comparative neurobiologists have long wondered when and how the dorsal pallium 
      (e.g., mammalian neocortex) evolved. For the last 50 years, the most widely accepted 
      answer has been that this structure was already present in the earliest vertebrates 
      and, therefore, homologous between the major vertebrate lineages. One challenge for 
      this hypothesis is that the olfactory bulbs project throughout most of the pallium 
      in the most basal vertebrate lineages (notably lampreys, hagfishes, and lungfishes) 
      but do not project to the putative dorsal pallia in teleosts, cartilaginous fishes, 
      and amniotes (i.e., reptiles, birds, and mammals). To make sense of these data, one 
      may hypothesize that a dorsal pallium existed in the earliest vertebrates and 
      received extensive olfactory input, which was subsequently lost in several lineages. 
      However, the dorsal pallium is notoriously difficult to delineate in many 
      vertebrates, and its homology between the various lineages is often based on little 
      more than its topology. Therefore, we suspect that dorsal pallia evolved 
      independently in teleosts, cartilaginous fishes, and amniotes. We further 
      hypothesize that the emergence of these dorsal pallia was accompanied by the 
      phylogenetic restriction of olfactory projections to the pallium and the expansion 
      of inputs from other sensory modalities. We do not deny that the earliest 
      vertebrates may have possessed nonolfactory sensory inputs to some parts of the 
      pallium, but such projections alone do not define a dorsal pallium.

TI  - Head and backbone of the Early Cambrian vertebrate Haikouichthys.
PG  - 526-9
AB  - Agnathan fish hold a key position in vertebrate evolution, especially regarding the 
      origin of the head and neural-crest-derived tissue. In contrast to amphioxus, 
      lampreys and other vertebrates possess a complex brain and placodes that contribute 
      to well-developed eyes, as well as auditory and olfactory systems. These sensory 
      sytems were arguably a trigger to subsequent vertebrate diversifications. However, 
      although they are known from skeletal impressions in younger Palaeozoic agnathans, 
      information about the earliest records of these systems has been largely wanting. 
      Here we report numerous specimens of the Lower Cambrian vertebrate Haikouichthys 
      ercaicunensis, until now only known from the holotype. Haikouichthys shows 
      significant differences from other fossil agnathans: key features include a small 
      lobate extension to the head, with eyes and possible nasal sacs, as well as what may 
      be otic capsules. A notochord with separate vertebral elements is also identifiable. 
      Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this fish lies within the stem-group craniates. 
      Although Haikouichthys somewhat resembles the ammocoete larva of modern lampreys, 
      this is because of shared general craniate characters; adult lampreys and hagfishes 
      (the cyclostomes if monophyletic) are probably derived in many respects.

AB  - Lampreys, together with hagfishes, are the only extant representatives of jawless 
      vertebrates and thus of prime interest for the study of vertebrate evolution [1]. 
      Most lamprey genera occur in two forms with divergent life histories: a parasitic, 
      anadromous and a non-parasitic, freshwater resident form [2-8]. The taxonomic status 
      of such 'paired species' is disputed, however. While indistinguishable at larval 
      stages, but clearly distinct as adults, they cannot be differentiated with available 
      genetic data [6,7], which has fuelled speculations that the two forms may in fact 
      represent products of phenotypic plasticity within a single species. Here, we use 
      restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) to examine the genetic 
      population structure of sympatric European river (Lampetra fluviatilis L., 1758) and 
      brook (Lampetra planeri Bloch, 1784) lampreys. We find strong genetic 
      differentiation and identify numerous fixed and diagnostic single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms (SNPs) between the two species, 12 of which can be unequivocally 
      assigned to specific genes.

TI  - The evolution of tendon--morphology and material properties.
PG  - 1159-70
AB  - Phylogenetically, tendinous tissue first appears in the invertebrate chordate 
      Branchiostoma as myosepta. This two-dimensional array of collagen fibers is highly 
      organized, with fibers running along two primary axes. In hagfish the first linear 
      tendons appear and the myosepta have developed specialized regions with 
      unidirectional fiber orientation-a linear tendon within the flat sheet of myoseptum. 
      Tendons react to compressive load by first forming a fibrocartilaginous pad, and 
      under severe stress, sesamoid bones. Evidence for this ability to react to load 
      first arises in the cartilaginous fish, here documented in a tendon from the jaw of 
      a hard-prey crushing stingray. Sesamoid bones are common in bony fish and also in 
      tetrapods. Tendons will also calcify under tensile loads in some groups of birds, 
      and this reaction to load is seen in no other vertebrates. We conclude that the 
      evolutionary history of tendon gives us insight into the use of model systems for 
      investigating tendon biology. Using mammal and fish models may be more appropriate 
      than avian models because of the apparent evolution of a novel reaction to tensile 
      loads in birds.

AB  - There is increasing demand for efficient methods to relate genomic information from 
      model organisms to other species of interest. Comparative genetic analyses are 
      particularly valuable to identify functionally important sequence features on the 
      basis of their evolutionary conservation. We demonstrate here how a single segment 
      of just 32 or less conserved coding nucleotide positions can be used to isolate 
      homologous gene sequences from large numbers of species using a single-sided PCR 
      technique. The method was used to isolate and determine the 3'-untranslated sequence 
      of the somatostatin gene from vertebrate species ranging from human to hagfish. Two 
      sequence motifs centered an average 40-145 nucleotides downstream of the 
      translational stop codon have remained conserved for up to 350 million years. One of 
      the conserved tetrapod segments was used to select a primer for amplification of 
      so-called comparative anchor tagged sequences (CATS) in regular PCR, and shown to 
      amplify homologous sequences from DNA samples from 30 out of 33 tetrapods. In 
      conclusion, we present a useful procedure to reveal functionally relevant sequence 
      elements, and to select primers for amplification of homologous sequences from a 
      wide range of species.

AB  - A purified cobra venom factor with C-inhibiting activity also promotes lysis of 
      erythrocytes in fresh mammalian serum. Lysis-inducing activity of purified cobra 
      venom factor was found in sera of lower vertebrates including the cyclostome hagfish 
      and in invertebrates. Lysis-inducing activity was most effective with frog serum. 
      Frog serum was found to be more hemolytic for E(s) in the presence of CVF than when 
      cells were sensitized with hemolysin. The hemolysis induced by CVF with frog serum, 
      as in the higher vertebrates, was inhibited when sera were pretreated with known C 
      inhibitors including heat, chelators, endotoxin, immune complexes, and CVF itself. 
      Complexes formed with CVF and either frog serum or invertebrate hemolymph promoted 
      lysis of indicator cells in the presence of frog serum in EDTA. This lysis was most 
      marked when the starfish-CVF complex was used and was C-dependent. Conversely, 
      complex formed with frog serum and CVF promoted lysis of E in the presence of 
      invertebrate hemolymph (Limulus) in EDTA. Hence, serum components were to some 
      degree at least interchangeable between vertebrate sera and invertebrate hemolymph. 
      Lysis-inducing activity of purified CVF occurs in a wide range of species, has 
      revealed activities resembling those of terminal C-components in lower vertebrates 
      and invertebrates, and provides one means for study of C and C-like activities in 
      primitive species.

TI  - Conformational correlation and coupled motion between residue A21 and B25 side chain 
      observed in crystal structures of insulin mutants at position A21.
PG  - 225-36
AB  - The C-terminal residue of the insulin A chain is invariant and kept as asparagine in 
      all known insulin molecules from hagfish through birds to mammals. To get 
      information on the role of this conserved residue, which is still unclear, the 
      three-dimensional structures of four human insulin mutants, A21 Asn-->Gly, A21 
      Asn-->Asp, A21 Asn-->Ala, and A21 Asn-->Gln DesB30, were determined by X-ray 
      crystallography. The four mutants crystallize separately into two kinds 
      (rhombohedral and cubic) of crystals. In the refined structures, conformational 
      correlation and coupled motion between the A chain C-terminal residue A21 and the 
      B25 side chain was observed, in contrast to the nearly unchanged general structures 
      as compared with the native insulin structures in their respective crystals. A 
      detailed analysis suggests that residue A21 can affect insulin receptor binding by 
      interaction with the B25 side chain and the B chain C-terminal segment to assist the 
      B25 side chain rearranging into the 'active' conformation.

AB  - The jawless vertebrates (lamprey and hagfish) evolved a novel adaptive immune system 
      with many similarities to that found in the jawed vertebrates, including the 
      production of antigen-specific circulating antibodies in response to immunization. 
      However, the jawless vertebrates use leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-based antigen 
      receptors termed variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) for immune recognition, 
      instead of immunoglobulin (Ig)-based receptors. VLR genes are assembled in 
      developing lymphocytes through a gene conversion-like process, in which hundreds of 
      LRR gene segments are randomly selected as template donors to generate a large 
      repertoire of distinct antigen receptors, similar to that found within the mammalian 
      adaptive immune system. Here we describe the development of a robust platform using 
      immunized lampreys (Petromyzon marinus) for generating libraries of 
      anti-carbohydrate (anti-glycan) variable lymphocyte receptor B, or VLRBs. The 
      anti-carbohydrate VLRBs are isolated using a yeast surface display (YSD) expression 
      platform and enriched by binding to glycan microarrays through the anti-glycan VLRB. 
      This enables both the initial identification and enrichment of individual yeast 
      clones against hundreds of glycans simultaneously. Through this enrichment strategy 
      a broad array of glycan-specific VLRs can be isolated from the YSD library. 
      Subsequently, the bound yeast cells are directly removed from the microarray, the 
      VLR antibody clone is sequenced, and the end product is expressed as a VLR-IgG-Fc 
      fusion protein that can be used for ELISA, Western blotting, flow cytometry, and 
      immunomicroscopy. Thus, by combining yeast surface display with glycan microarray 
      technology, we have developed a rapid, efficient, and novel method for generating 
      chimeric VLR-IgG-Fc proteins that recognize a broad array of unique glycan 
      structures with exquisite specificity.

AB  - Intermediate filament (IF) proteins are known mainly by their propensity to form 
      viscoelastic filamentous networks within cells. In addition, IF-proteins are 
      essential parts of various biological materials, such as horn and hagfish slime 
      threads, which exhibit a range of mechanical properties from hard to elastic. These 
      properties and their self-assembly nature made IF-proteins attractive building 
      blocks for biomimetic and biological materials in diverse applications. Here we show 
      that a type V IF-protein, the Caenorhabditis elegans nuclear lamin (Ce-lamin), is a 
      promising building block for protein-based fibers. Electron cryo-tomography of 
      vitrified sections enabled us to depict the higher ordered assembly of the Ce-lamin 
      into macroscopic fibers through the creation of paracrystalline fibers, which are 
      prominent in vitro structures of lamins. The lamin fibers respond to tensile force 
      as other IF-protein-based fibers, i.e., hagfish slime threads, and possess unique 
      mechanical properties that may potentially be used in certain applications. The 
      self-assembly nature of lamin proteins into a filamentous structure, which is 
      further assembled into a complex network, can be easily modulated. This knowledge 
      may lead to a better understanding of the relationship in IF-proteins-based fibers 
      and materials, between their hierarchical structures and their mechanical 
      properties.

TI  - Photoaffinity labeling of the Ah receptor: phylogenetic survey of diverse vertebrate 
      and invertebrate species.
PG  - 218-28
AB  - The mammalian aromatic hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor is a soluble protein involved in 
      the regulation of gene expression by halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons such as 
      2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Little is known, however, about the 
      presence and properties of this receptor in nonmammalian species. In these studies, 
      we sought evidence for an Ah receptor in the liver or liver-equivalent of diverse 
      species of invertebrate and vertebrate animals. Velocity sedimentation analysis of 
      hepatic cytosol labeled with [3H]TCDD gave equivocal results with three species of 
      marine fish. In subsequent studies, photoaffinity labeling with 
      2-azido-3-[125I]iodo-7,8-dibromodibenzo-p-dioxin was used to identify the Ah 
      receptor. Specific labeling (labeling that could be displaced by an excess of 
      unlabeled ligand) was observed in seven species of teleost and elasmobranch fish, 
      including winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus), killifish (Fundulus 
      heteroclitus), scup (Stenotomus chrysops), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), 
      brown trout (Salmo trutta), and dogfish (Mustelus canis and Squalus acanthias). 
      Specific labeling was also found in cytosolic fractions prepared from PLHC-1 fish 
      hepatoma cells and livers of a turtle (Chrysemys picta) and a cetacean, the beluga 
      whale Delphinapterus leucas. The fish Ah receptor was sensitive to conditions of 
      tissue preparation; inclusion of proteinase inhibitors in the homogenization buffer 
      stabilized the receptor in some species. There was heterogeneity in the apparent 
      molecular mass of the largest specifically labeled band in each species; these 
      ranged from 105 to 146 kDa, slightly larger on average than mammalian Ah receptors 
      (95-130 kDa). In contrast to the results obtained with teleost and elasmobranch 
      fish, no specifically labeled polypeptides were detectable in cytosol from two 
      agnathan fish species (hagfish Myxine glutinosa and sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus), 
      the tunicate Ciona intestinalis, or any of nine other invertebrate species 
      representing eight classes in four phyla. Overall these results suggest that the Ah 
      receptor evolved at least 450 million years ago, prior to the divergence of bony and 
      cartilaginous fishes. Although the exact relationship between receptor presence and 
      dioxin responsiveness in these species is uncertain, our data predict that the 
      invertebrate species examined in this study, which appear to lack an Ah receptor 
      protein like that seen in mammals and fish, may be less sensitive than vertebrates 
      to the effects of environmental contaminants that act through this transcriptional 
      regulator.

TI  - Evolution of adaptive immunity: implications of a third lymphocyte lineage in 
      lampreys.
PG  - 244-50
LID - 10.1002/bies.201300145 [doi]
AB  - An alternative antigen receptor, named the variable lymphocyte receptor (VLR), was 
      first identified in lampreys in 2004. Since then, the mechanism of VLR 
      diversification via somatic gene assembly and the function of VLR-expressing 
      lymphocytes have been the subject of much research. VLRs comprise leucine-rich 
      repeat (LRR) motifs and are found only in the most phylogenetically distant 
      vertebrates from mammals, lampreys, and hagfish. Previous reports showed that VLRA 
      and VLRB are reciprocally expressed by lymphocytes that resemble T- and B cells; 
      however, more recent reports show that another VLR, VLRC, is expressed on a third 
      lymphocyte lineage, which may be equivalent to γδ T cells. The existence of three 
      major lymphocyte lineages - one B-cell-like and two T-cell-like - and their 
      development in lampreys, parallels the mammalian adaptive immune system. This 
      suggests that these three cell lineages were present in the common vertebrate 
      ancestor approximately 500 million years ago.

TI  - Hox genes and chordate evolution.
PG  - 382-95
AB  - Hox genes are implicated in the control of axial patterning during embryonic 
      development of many, perhaps all, animals. Here we review recent data on Hox gene 
      diversity, genomic organization, and embryonic expression in chordates (including 
      tunicates, amphioxus, hagfish, lampreys, teleosts) plus their putative sister group, 
      the hemichordates. We consider the potential of comparative Hox gene data to resolve 
      some outstanding controversies in chordate phylogeny. The use of Hox gene expression 
      patterns to identify homologies between body plans both within the vertebrates and 
      between the chordate subphyla is also discussed. Homology between the vertebrate 
      hindbrain and an extensive region of amphioxus neural tube is suggested by 
      comparison of Hox-3 homologues and strengthened by new data on amphioxus Hox-1 gene 
      expression reported here. Finally, we give two examples of how Hox genes are giving 
      glimpses into chordate developmental evolution. The first relates changes in Hox 
      gene expression to transposition of vertebral of vertebral identities; the second 
      describes a correlation between vertebrate origins and Hox gene cluster duplication. 
      We suggest that the simultaneous duplication of many classes of genes, often 
      interacting in gene networks, allowed the elaboration of new developmental control 
      mechanisms at vertebrate origins.

AB  - All surviving jawed vertebrate representatives achieve diversity in 
      immunoglobulin-based B and T cell receptors for antigen recognition through 
      recombinatorial rearrangement of V(D)J segments. However, the extant jawless 
      vertebrates, lampreys and hagfish, instead generate three types of variable 
      lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) through a template-mediated combinatorial assembly of 
      different leucine-rich repeat (LRR) sequences. The clonally diverse VLRB receptors 
      are expressed by B-like lymphocytes, while the VLRA and VLRC receptors are expressed 
      by lymphocyte lineages that resemble αβ and γδ T lymphocytes, respectively. These 
      findings suggest that three basic types of lymphocytes, one B-like and two T-like, 
      are an essential feature of vertebrate adaptive immunity. Around 500 million years 
      ago, a common ancestor of jawed and jawless vertebrates evolved a genetic program 
      for the development of prototypic lymphoid cells as a foundation for an adaptive 
      immune system. This acquisition preceded the convergent evolution of alternative 
      types of clonally diverse receptors for antigens in all vertebrates, as reviewed in 
      this article.

TI  - Purification and characterization of ostrich prothrombin.
PG  - 1151-9
AB  - The work focused on the penultimate enzyme, prothrombin, in the coagulation cascade. 
      Prothrombin was purified and characterized from ostrich plasma. The results obtained 
      contribute to a better understanding of blood coagulation in the ostrich and the 
      evolution of prothrombin and the coagulation cascade. Prothrombin was purified from 
      ostrich plasma by barium chloride precipitation, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and 
      DEAE-cellulose and Cu(2+)-chelate Sepharose chromatography. Ostrich prothrombin 
      exhibited a M(r) of 72,800 and a pI of 6.9 using SDS-PAGE and 
      PAG-isoelectrofocusing, respectively. The N-terminal sequence of ostrich prothrombin 
      showed 78 and 87% identity with human and bovine, respectively. The cDNA was 
      isolated from ostrich liver and the predicted amino acid sequence compared with 
      those from other species. Ostrich prothrombin shares sequence identity with chicken 
      (84%), human (60%), bovine (59%), rat (60%), mouse (59%) and hagfish (50%) 
      prothrombin, suggesting a common function of prothrombin in these vertebrates. Amino 
      acid sequence identities indicate that the thrombin beta-chain (62%) and the 
      propeptide-Gla (75%) domains are the regions most constrained for the common 
      functions of vertebrate prothrombins. Ostrich prothrombin, therefore, shows 
      similarity in structure to other vertebrate prothrombins.

TI  - Organization of sensory and motor nuclei of the trigeminal nerve in lampreys.
PG  - 437-48
AB  - Anterograde and retrograde HRP transport were used to elucidate the primary central 
      projections of the trigeminal nerve in a lamprey, Lampetra japonica, by application 
      to the ophthalmic, apical, basilar, suborbital, and mandibular branches of the 
      trigeminal nerve. (1) Most of the trigeminal and a few facial ganglion cells were 
      labeled. The ganglion cells of each nerve were distributed in separate areas within 
      their respective ganglia. (2) Some ipsilateral medullary and spinal dorsal cells 
      were labeled after HRP application to the ophthalmic and apical nerves, but there 
      was no contralateral labeling. (3) Most of the neurons of the trigeminal motor 
      nucleus were labeled, and when the apical or the basilar nerve was labeled, in each 
      case a cluster of small motor neurons was found ventrolateral to the classic motor 
      nucleus. (4) Miscellaneous neurons were found scattered along the course of the 
      descending trigeminal tract and nucleus in all cases except after application to the 
      mandibular branch. The shape, size, and distribution patterns of these neurons were 
      varied, and several characteristics indicated that they were sensory in nature. (5) 
      In the rostral part of the medulla, sensory fibers of each nerve showed restricted 
      localization within the descending trigeminal tract and nucleus. When compared to 
      the distribution of the same fibers in the hagfish Eptatretus burgeri, another 
      member of the cyclostomes, the distribution pattern in the lampreys studied was 
      closer to the type seen in gnathostomes.

TI  - Evolution of Vertebrate Phototransduction: Cascade Activation.
PG  - 2064-87
LID - 10.1093/molbev/msw095 [doi]
AB  - We applied high-throughput sequencing to eye tissue from several species of basal 
      vertebrates (a hagfish, two species of lamprey, and five species of gnathostome 
      fish), and we analyzed the mRNA sequences for the proteins underlying activation of 
      the phototransduction cascade. The molecular phylogenies that we constructed from 
      these sequences are consistent with the 2R WGD model of two rounds of whole genome 
      duplication. Our analysis suggests that agnathans retain an additional 
      representative (that has been lost in gnathostomes) in each of the gene families we 
      studied; the evidence is strong for the G-protein α subunit (GNAT) and the cGMP 
      phosphodiesterase (PDE6), and indicative for the cyclic nucleotide-gated channels 
      (CNGA and CNGB). Two of the species (the hagfish Eptatretus cirrhatus and the 
      lamprey Mordacia mordax) possess only a single class of photoreceptor, simplifying 
      deductions about the composition of cascade protein isoforms utilized in their 
      photoreceptors. For the other lamprey, Geotria australis, analysis of the ratios of 
      transcript levels in downstream and upstream migrant animals permits tentative 
      conclusions to be drawn about the isoforms used in four of the five spectral classes 
      of photoreceptor. Overall, our results suggest that agnathan rod-like photoreceptors 
      utilize the same GNAT1 as gnathostomes, together with a homodimeric PDE6 that may be 
      agnathan-specific, whereas agnathan cone-like photoreceptors utilize a GNAT that may 
      be agnathan-specific, together with the same PDE6C as gnathostomes. These findings 
      help elucidate the evolution of the vertebrate phototransduction cascade from an 
      ancestral chordate phototransduction cascade that existed prior to the vertebrate 
      radiation.

TI  - The evolution and elaboration of vertebrate neural crest cells.
PG  - 536-43
LID - 10.1016/j.gde.2008.11.006 [doi]
AB  - Vertebrate neural crest cells are embryonic neuroepithelial cells that undergo an 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migrate throughout the embryo and form a wide 
      variety of derivatives, including peripheral neurons and glia, pigment cells, and 
      craniofacial cartilage, bone and teeth. Neural crest cell evolution and elaboration 
      is intimately bound up with vertebrate evolution: the most primitive living 
      vertebrates, lampreys and hagfishes, have most but not all neural crest derivatives. 
      A torrent of recent molecular information has changed our understanding of 
      vertebrate phylogenetic relationships, expanded our understanding of the gene 
      circuitry underlying neural crest development, and given interesting information on

PG  - 247-57
AB  - Lampreys belong to the class of Cyclostomata; practically no evolution of these 
      Vertebrates can be noted since Paleozoïc times; lampreys thus appear as a choice 
      material for studying several problems in the field of biochemical evolution. 
      Several monomeric haemoglobins can be characterized in the erythrocytes of the sea 
      lamprey (Petromyzon marinus). The major constituent was isolated by chromatography, 
      and submitted to tryptic digestion; soluble tryptic peptides were separated by gel 
      filtration into 5 fractions; the peptides of each fraction were isolated either by 
      Dowex-50 chromatography or by HPLC; the insoluble core was oxidized and submitted to 
      HPLC fractionation. The primary structure of the whole chain and of the purified 
      tryptic peptides was determined using automatic sequencing; alignment of the 
      peptides was achieved by homology with the previously established covalent structure 
      of the globin of Lampetra fluviatilis. The sequence we established confirms the 
      crystallographic data of Hendrickson and Love. Globin/haem contacts are discussed; a 
      tentative explanation of the absence of tetramerization can be proposed after 
      comparison with the aminoacid residues involved in alpha 1 beta 1 and alpha 1 beta 2 
      contacts. Petromyzon globin differs at three locations (Thr/Ser3, Leu/Met58, 
      Thr/Ser60) from Lampetra fluviatilis globin. The monomeric chain of another 
      Cyclostomata Myxine glutinosa, differs more considerably (88 residues). Our results 
      corroborate recent paleontologic data which favour the separation of lampreys from 
      hagfishes; Cyclostomata cannot be considered as a monophylic group. Finally, there 
      is a closer relation between lamprey globin and alpha chains than between this 
      monomeric globin and beta chains, and furthermore apomyoglobins of higher 
      vertebrates.

AB  - Classically the immunological 'Big Bang' of adaptive immunity was believed to have 
      resulted from the insertion of a transposon into an immunoglobulin superfamily gene 
      member, initiating antigen receptor gene rearrangement via the RAG recombinase in an 
      ancestor of jawed vertebrates. However, the discovery of a second, convergent 
      adaptive immune system in jawless fish, focused on the so-called variable lymphocyte 
      receptors (VLRs), was arguably the most exciting finding of the past decade in 
      immunology and has drastically changed the view of immune origins. The recent report 
      of a new lymphocyte lineage in lampreys, defined by the antigen receptor VLRC, 
      suggests that there were three lymphocyte lineages in the common ancestor of jawless 
      and jawed vertebrates that co-opted different antigen receptor supertypes. The 
      transcriptional control of these lineages during development is predicted to be 
      remarkably similar in both the jawless (agnathan) and jawed (gnathostome) 
      vertebrates, suggesting that an early 'division of labor' among lymphocytes was a 
      driving force in the emergence of adaptive immunity. The recent cartilaginous fish 
      genome project suggests that most effector cytokines and chemokines were also 
      present in these fish, and further studies of the lamprey and hagfish genomes will 
      determine just how explosive the Big Bang actually was.

AB  - The concept of adaptive immunity suggests de novo generation in each individual of 
      extremely large repertoires of diversified receptors and selective expansion of 
      receptors that match the antigen/pathogen. Accordingly, adaptive immune system is 
      also called "anticipatory". It allows each individual to have a unique repertoire of 
      immune receptors corresponding to its life history. The memory of an antigen gets 
      encoded in the clonal composition of the organism's immune cells instead of being 
      encoded in the genome. Consequently, the immune response to repeated encounter with 
      the same antigen becomes stronger, a phenomenon called immunological memory. 
      Elements of adaptive immunity are found at all taxonomical levels, whereas in 
      vertebrates, adaptive mechanisms have become the cornerstone of the immune system. 
      In jaw vertebrates, adaptive immune receptors of T and B lymphoid cells belong to 
      immunoglobulin superfamily and are created by rearrangement of gene segments. In 
      jawless vertebrates lamprey and hagfish, recombination of leucine-rich repeat 
      modules is used to form variable lymphocyte receptors. Striking functional 
      similarity of the cellular and humoral branches of these systems suggests similar 
      driving forces underlying their development.

      Vertebrate Evolution.

LID - 10.1093/gbe/evaa140 [doi]
AB  - The evolution of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily (TNFSF) in early vertebrates 
      is inferred by comparing the TNFSF genes found in humans and nine fishes: three 
      agnathans, two chondrichthyans, three actinopterygians, and the sarcopterygian 
      Latimeria chalumnae. By combining phylogenetic and synteny analyses, the TNFSF 
      sequences detected are classified into five clusters of genes and 24 orthology 
      groups. A model for their evolution since the origin of vertebrates is proposed. 
      Fifteen TNFSF genes emerged from just three progenitors due to the whole-genome 
      duplications (WGDs) that occurred before the agnathan/gnathostome split. Later, 
      gnathostomes not only kept most of the genes emerged in the WGDs but soon added 
      several tandem duplicates. More recently, complex, lineage-specific patterns of 
      duplications and losses occurred in different gnathostome lineages. In agnathan 
      species only seven to eight TNFSF genes are detected, because this lineage soon lost 
      six of the genes emerged in the ancestral WGDs and additional losses in both 
      hagfishes and lampreys later occurred. The orthologs of many of these lost genes 
      are, in mammals, ligands of death-domain-containing TNFSF receptors, indicating that 
      the extrinsic apoptotic pathway became simplified in the agnathan lineage. From the 
      patterns of emergence of these genes, it is deduced that both the regulation of 
      apoptosis and the control of the NF-κB pathway that depends in modern mammals on 
      TNFSF members emerged before the ancestral vertebrate WGDs.

TI  - Development and Functional Organization of the Cranial Nerves in Lampreys.
PG  - 512-539
LID - 10.1002/ar.23821 [doi]
AB  - Lampreys, together with hagfishes, are the only extant representatives of the oldest 
      branch of vertebrates, the agnathans, which are the sister group of gnathostomes; 
      therefore, studies on these animals are of great evolutionary significance. Lampreys 
      exhibit a particular life cycle with remarkable changes in their behavior, 
      concomitant, in part, with important modifications in the head and its musculature, 
      which might influence the development of the cranial nerves. In this context, some 
      cranial nerves such as the optic nerve and the ocular motor nerves, which develop 
      slowly during an extremely long larval period lasting more than five years, have 
      been more thoroughly investigated; however, much less experimental information is 
      available about others, such as the facial or the hypoglossal nerves. In addition, 
      the possible existence of a "true" accessory nerve in these animals is still a 
      matter of conjecture. Although growing in last decades, investigations on the 
      physiology of the lamprey cranial nerves is scanty. This review focuses on past and 
      recent findings that have contributed to characterize the anatomical organization of 
      the cranial nerves in lampreys, including their components and nuclei, and their 
      relations in the brain; in addition, comments on their development and functional 
      role are also included. Anat Rec, 302:512-539, 2019. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - A nature-inspired lubricant-infused surface for sustainable drag reduction.
PG  - 8459-8467
LID - 10.1039/c9sm01576k [doi]
AB  - Reduction of frictional drag exerted on submerged marine vehicles results in 
      considerable economic and environmental benefits. A lubricant-infused surface (LIS) 
      inspired by Nepenthes pitcher was introduced as an emerging surface technology for 
      substantial frictional drag reduction. However, the LIS easily loses its 
      drag-reduction ability because the lubricant is easily depleted by shear stresses of 
      external flow. In this study, a new biomimetic LIS with a unique surface topography 
      is proposed to increase the sustainability of the infused lubricant. This biomimetic 
      LIS has re-entrant shaped cavities in the surface, inspired by the mucus secretion 
      and storage systems of loach, hagfish, and seaweed, whose skin can sustain slippery 
      mucus layers even under continuous exposure to harsh seawater flow conditions. The 
      slippery characteristics and enhanced sustainability of the biomimetic LIS were 
      investigated by directly measurement of the slip length and pressure loss in channel 
      flow over the LIS. The frictional drag reduction efficiency of the biomimetic LIS 
      was measured to be approximately 18% compared with the corresponding no-slip 
      surface. Moreover, the excellent sustainability of the biomimetic LIS was 
      demonstrated by comparing the drag-reduction abilities before and after exposure to 
      a high shear flow. The high durability might be attributed to the re-entrant shaped 
      surface topography of the biomimetic LIS. The present results would provide insights 
      into the design of a robust and sustainable LIS for practical drag reduction 
      applications.

TI  - Molecular phylogeny and divergence times of deuterostome animals.
PG  - 2275-84
AB  - The phylogenetic relationships among deuterostome animals have been debated for many 
      years, and a diversity of hypotheses have been proposed based on both morphological 
      and molecular data. Here we have assembled sequences of 217 nuclear-encoded proteins 
      to address specific questions concerning their relationships and times of origin. We 
      recovered significant support for urochordates as the closest relative of 
      vertebrates with an analysis of 59 proteins (17,400 amino acids) and suggest that 
      the basal position of urochordates found in previous molecular studies may have been 
      the result of long-branch attraction biases. Our results also support Ambulacraria, 
      the pairing of hemichordates with echinoderms (nine proteins; 2,382 amino acids), 
      and Cyclostomata, the pairing of lampreys with hagfish (25 proteins; 6,895 amino 
      acids). In addition, 325 shared proteins (102,110 amino acids) were obtained from 
      the complete genomes of six vertebrates and a urochordate for phylogenetic analysis 
      and divergence time estimation. An evolutionary timescale was estimated using a 
      local (Bayesian) molecular clock method. We found that most major lineages of 
      deuterostomes arose prior to the Cambrian Explosion of fossils (approximately 520 
      MYA) and that several lineages had originated before periods of global glaciation in 
      the Precambrian.

TI  - The sympathetic nervous system of anamniotes.
PG  - 105-13
AB  - The sympathetic nervous system develops as an evolutionary trait with gnathostomes 
      (jawed vertebrates), but not with agnathan fishes (i.e., hagfishes and lampreys). 
      Organization of the sympathetic preganglionic neuronal columns is different in 
      teleosts and anurans. In the teleosts so far examined, the majority of sympathetic 
      preganglionic neurons (SPNs) are located in the dorsal part of the spinal central 
      gray matter. In Tetraodontiformes, the cell column occupies only two rostral spinal 
      segments, which are distinct in their cytoarchitecture and projections. On the other 
      hand, the SPNs of anurans form two cell columns segregated mediolaterally. The 
      lateral and medial columns are also distinct in their cytoarchitecture and 
      projections. The neuroactive substances expressed in the SPNs both in teleosts and 
      anurans are coded to the projections. In anurans, the SPNs containing 
      gonadotrophin-releasing hormone and those containing calcitonin gene-related peptide 
      are involved in the regulation of blood vessels and cutaneous glands, respectively. 
      In the filefish, the SPNs containing galanin project specifically to non-adrenergic 
      non-cholinergic postganglionic neurons in the cranial sympathetic ganglia. 
      Therefore, both anuran and teleost systems have different morphological and 
      chemical-coded patterns for functional variation, although the anuran sympathetic 
      nervous system has more organizational similarity with that of amniotes.

AB  - In most multicellular organisms, the structure and content of the genome is 
      rigorously maintained over the course of development. However some species have 
      evolved genome biologies that permit, or require, developmentally regulated changes 
      in the physical structure and content of the genome (programmed genome 
      rearrangement: PGR). Relatively few vertebrates are known to undergo PGR, although 
      all agnathans surveyed to date (several hagfish and one lamprey: Petromyzon marinus) 
      show evidence of large scale PGR. To further resolve the ancestry of PGR within 
      vertebrates, we developed probes that allow simultaneous tracking of nearly all 
      sequences eliminated by PGR in P. marinus and a second lamprey species (Entosphenus 
      tridentatus). These comparative analyses reveal conserved subcellular structures 
      (lagging chromatin and micronuclei) associated with PGR and provide the first 
      comparative embryological evidence in support of the idea that PGR represents an 
      ancient and evolutionarily stable strategy for regulating inherent 
      developmental/genetic conflicts between germline and soma.

AB  - Lamprey and hagfish are surviving representatives of the most ancient vertebrates. 
      They possess adaptive immune systems based on a vast, somatically diversified 
      repertoire of lymphocyte-bound antigen receptors. Despite these similarities to 
      antibody and T cell receptors (TCR) of later vertebrates, the variable lymphocyte 
      receptors (VLR) are not related to the immunoglobulin (Ig)-superfamily of genes; and 
      instead of V(D)J recombination VLR are somatically assembled by a gene conversion 
      process. However, recent studies have revealed two lamprey lymphocyte subsets so 
      closely resembling B cells and T cells that separate lymphocyte lineages must have 
      already existed in the ancestral vertebrate, before Ig/TCR emergence. VLR and Ig/TCR 
      arose independently, but the convergent evolution they display actually reflects 
      their selection in cells with specialized functions.

TI  - Terminal nerve complex.
PG  - 81-95
AB  - Cranial nerve 0 or the terminal nerve (nervus terminalis: TN) refers to a nerve or 
      in some cases possibly a complex of nerves that most likely derive from the 
      olfactory placodes and relate the most anterior forebrain derivatives to nasal and 
      olfactory structures. Such a nerve(s) has been observed in at least some stages of 
      development in all major groups of vertebrates save myxinoids or hagfish. The 
      phylogenetic variation of TN components is presented in some detail. The functions 
      of TN components are not yet well identified, but some indications are that it is 
      sensory but not chemosensory, controls blood vessels and glands in the nose and has 
      peptide-containing fibers that may control reproductive development and behavior as 
      well as other neural functions. This paper has three parts: (1) a historical review, 
      which provides a conceptual framework necessary for understanding current problems 
      in the anatomy and physiology of the TN; (2) a section on recent studies in areas 
      selected for their potential impact on understanding the TN, and (3) a brief 
      summary, which provides some tentative answers to the questions 'what is the TN and 
      what does it do?' and suggests directions for continued research on the TN.

TI  - A survey of occurrence of about seventeen circumventricular organs in brains of 
      various vertebrates with special reference to lower groups.
PG  - 441-70
AB  - The occurrence of about 17 circumventricular organs is described in 31 species 
      belonging to various groups of vertebrates from cyclostomes to mammals and the 
      phylogeny of each organ is discussed briefly. The neurohypophysis (median eminence 
      and neural lobe) and the subcommissural organ are observed in all species studied. 
      The pineal is also ubiquitous except for the hagfish (Eptatretus) and the caiman 
      (Caiman). These four circumventricular organs are phylogenetically the oldest 
      organs. The subfornical organ and the area postrema may be phylogenetically the 
      youngest organs, although the subfornical organ is found in the lungfish 
      (Lepidosiren) and the area postrema is observed in the dogfish (Mustelus) and the 
      brachiopterygians (Polypterus and Erpetoichthys) among the piscine vertebrates 
      studied. The other significant findings may be summarized as follows. 
      Osteoglossomorphous teleosts (Osteoglossum and Gnathonemus) possess a distinct 
      median eminence. The median eminence of the caiman (Caiman) is divided into the 
      anterior and posterior parts as in birds. The saccus vasculosus is observed in the 
      freshwater ray (Potamotrygon), but not in the freshwater teleost (Osteoglossum). The 
      organum vasculosum laminae terminalis of the dogfish (Etmopterus) contains 
      fuchsinophilic neurosecretory fiber terminals and is considered as the neurohemal 
      organ. The paraventricular organ is not differentiated in the lungfish (Lepidosiren) 
      and the caecilian (Typhlonectes). The paraphysis is found in the dogfish (Mustelus) 
      and the osteoglossomorphous teleosts (Osteoglossum and Gnathonemus). The so-called 
      paraphysis of the lungfish is not a paraphysis, but a dorsal sac. The development of 
      the subfornical organ is variable among amphibians. The area postrema is well 
      developed in the caecilian (Typhlonectes).

TI  - Evidence for Natural Selection in Nucleotide Content Relationships Based on Complete 
      Mitochondrial Genomes: Strong Effect of Guanine Content on Separation between 
      Terrestrial and Aquatic Vertebrates.
PG  - 1-5
LID - 10.2174/2213988501509010001 [doi]
AB  - The complete vertebrate mitochondrial genome consists of 13 coding genes. We used 
      this genome to investigate the existence of natural selection in vertebrate 
      evolution. From the complete mitochondrial genomes, we predicted nucleotide contents 
      and then separated these values into coding and non-coding regions. When nucleotide 
      contents of a coding or non-coding region were plotted against the nucleotide 
      content of the complete mitochondrial genomes, we obtained linear regression lines 
      only between homonucleotides and their analogs. On every plot using G or A content 
      purine, G content in aquatic vertebrates was higher than that in terrestrial 
      vertebrates, while A content in aquatic vertebrates was lower than that in 
      terrestrial vertebrates. Based on these relationships, vertebrates were separated 
      into two groups, terrestrial and aquatic. However, using C or T content pyrimidine, 
      clear separation between these two groups was not obtained. The hagfish (Eptatretus 
      burgeri) was further separated from both terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates. Based 
      on these results, nucleotide content relationships predicted from the complete 
      vertebrate mitochondrial genomes reveal the existence of natural selection based on 
      evolutionary separation between terrestrial and aquatic vertebrate groups. In 
      addition, we propose that separation of the two groups might be linked to ammonia 
      detoxification based on high G and low A contents, which encode Glu rich and Lys 
      poor proteins.

AB  - Lampreys, together with hagfishes, represent the sister group of gnathostome 
      vertebrates. There is an increasing interest for comparing the forebrain 
      organization observed in lampreys and gnathostomes to shed light on vertebrate brain 
      evolution. Within the prosencephalon, there is now a general agreement on the major 
      subdivisions of the lamprey diencephalon; however, the organization of the 
      telencephalon, and particularly its pallial subdivisions, is still a matter of 
      controversy. In this study, recent progress on the development and organization of 
      the lamprey telencephalon is reviewed, with particular emphasis on the GABA 
      immunoreactive cell populations trying to understand their putative origin. First, 
      we describe some early general cytoarchitectonic events by searching the classical 
      literature as well as our collection of embryonic and prolarval series of 
      hematoxylin-stained sections. Then, we comment on the cell proliferation activity 
      throughout the larval period, followed by a detailed description of the early events 
      on the development of the telencephalic GABAergic system. In this context, lampreys 
      apparently do not possess the same molecularly distinct subdivisions of the 
      gnathostome basal telencephalon because of the absence of a Nkx2.1-expressing domain 
      in the developing subpallium; a fact that has been related to the absence of a 
      medial ganglionic eminence as well as of its derived nucleus in gnathostomes, the 
      pallidum. Therefore, these data raise interesting questions such as whether or not a 
      different mechanism to specify telencephalic GABAergic neurons exists in lampreys or 
      what are their migration pathways. Finally, we summarize the organization of the 
      adult lamprey telencephalon by analyzing the main proposed conceptions, including 
      the available data on the expression pattern of some developmental regulatory genes 
      which are of importance for building its adult shape.

TI  - Lamprey type II collagen and Sox9 reveal an ancient origin of the vertebrate 
      collagenous skeleton.
PG  - 3180-5
AB  - Type II collagen is the major cartilage matrix protein in the jawed vertebrate 
      skeleton. Lampreys and hagfishes, by contrast, are thought to have noncollagenous 
      cartilage. This difference in skeletal structure has led to the hypothesis that the 
      vertebrate common ancestor had a noncollagenous skeleton, with type II collagen 
      becoming the predominant cartilage matrix protein after the divergence of jawless 
      fish from the jawed vertebrates approximately 500 million years ago. Here we report 
      that lampreys have two type II collagen (Col2alpha1) genes that are expressed during 
      development of the cartilaginous skeleton. We also demonstrate that the adult 
      lamprey skeleton is rich in Col2alpha1 protein. Furthermore, we have isolated a 
      lamprey orthologue of Sox9, a direct transcriptional regulator of Col2alpha1 in 
      jawed vertebrates, and show that it is coexpressed with both Col2alpha1 genes during 
      skeletal development. These results reveal that the genetic pathway for 
      chondrogenesis in lampreys and gnathostomes is conserved through the activation of 
      cartilage matrix molecules and suggest that a collagenous skeleton evolved 
      surprisingly early in vertebrate evolution.

TI  - Fish gill morphology: inside out.
PG  - 192-213
AB  - In this short review of fish gill morphology we cover some basic gross anatomy as 
      well as in some more detail the microscopic anatomy of the branchial epithelia from 
      representatives of the major extant groups of fishes (Agnathans, Elasmobranchs, and 
      Teleosts). The agnathan hagfishes have primitive gill pouches, while the lampreys 
      have arch-like gills similar to the higher fishes. In the lampreys and 
      elasmobranchs, the gill filaments are supported by a complete interbranchial septum 
      and water exits via external branchial slits or pores. In contrast, the teleost 
      interbranchial septum is much reduced, leaving the ends of the filaments unattached, 
      and the multiple gill openings are replaced by the single caudal opening of the 
      operculum. The basic functional unit of the gill is the filament, which supports 
      rows of plate-like lamellae. The lamellae are designed for gas exchange with a large 
      surface area and a thin epithelium surrounding a well-vascularized core of pillar 
      cell capillaries. The lamellae are positioned for the blood flow to be 
      counter-current to the water flow over the gills. Despite marked differences in the 
      gross anatomy of the gill among the various groups, the cellular constituents of the 
      epithelium are remarkably similar. The lamellar gas-exchange surface is covered by 
      squamous pavement cells, while large, mitochondria-rich, ionocytes and mucocytes are 
      found in greatest frequency in the filament epithelium. Demands for ionoregulation 
      can often upset this balance. There has been much study of the structure and 
      function of the branchial mitochondria-rich cells. These cells are generally 
      characterized by a high mitochondrial density and an amplification of the 
      basolateral membrane through folding or the presence of an intracellular tubular 
      system. Morphological subtypes of MRCs as well as some methods of MRC detection are 
      discussed.

TI  - Hormones, ionic regulation and kidney function in fishes.
PG  - 245-65
AB  - Renal osmoregulatory mechanisms in the context of hormones is considered in three 
      types of fish: the Agnatha, the Chondrichthyes and the Osteichthyes. Particular 
      reference is made to endocrine status and hormonal interplay in renal homeostatic 
      mechanisms. Among Agnatha, hagfishes display atypical osmoregulatory characteristics 
      and their endocrine repertoire is poorly understood. Hormonal actions are unclear 
      although the kidney appears to act as a regulator of extracellular fluid volume. 
      Lampreys show many similarities with teleost fish with respect to osmoregulation, 
      but again their endocrine system requires further definition. Chondricthyean fishes 
      have a number of unique hormones, among them 1-alpha-hydroxycorticosterone from the 
      adrenocortical homologue (interrenal gland). Their complex kidneys have not been 
      extensively studied with respect to hormonal regulation, but a key role is certainly 
      the maintenance of high plasma levels of urea and trimethylamine oxide. The 
      importance of the ratio of these two compounds with respect to urea tolerance is 
      discussed. Evidence is presented and discussed that points to 
      1-alpha-hydroxycorticosterone playing a role in osmoregulation, although its sites 
      and mechanisms of action are not known. The presence of a non-hypophysial control of 
      interrenal function (a renin-angiotensin system) is indicated. The largest group of 
      fishes, the Teleostei, are considered with respect to renal mechanisms involved in 
      euryhalinity. Highly selective reference is made to the renin-angiotensin system and 
      arginine vasotocin. In fresh water eels a clear negative feedback relationship 
      exists between angiotensin II and arginine vasotocin, while in seawater-adapted 
      animals the interplay is less clear. It is suggested that the observed increases in 
      both arginine vasotocin and angiotensin II in eels adapted to environments 
      hyperosmotic to their extracellular fluid in some way affects the "setting" of the 
      feedback between the two. The possible interactions with other hormones is 
      considered in outline.

TI  - Cytochemistry of CSF-contacting neurons and pinealocytes.
PG  - 299-306
AB  - Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-immunoreactive neurons of the paraventricular organ 
      of the bony fish Coregonus albus send dendrites into the third ventricle. Their 
      axons run to the synaptic zone of the infundibular lobe. The dendrites may take up 
      some chemical information from the third ventricle, while the axons communicate it 
      to the neuropil of the hypothalamus perhaps to modify its activity according to the 
      state of the CSF. Serotonin-immunoreactive CSF-contacting neurons in the spinal cord 
      of the hagfish Myxine glutinosa from dendrite terminals in the central canal and 
      bear stereocilia like known mechanoreceptors. The Reissner's fiber runs above the 
      stereocilia and flows out from the central canal through its caudal opening. 
      Possibly, the fiber keeps open this aperture and ensures the flow of the CSF, which 
      may serve as a mechanoreceptory input for the CSF-contacting neurons. In the pineal 
      recess of hedgehog, CSF-contacting pinealocytes develop enlarged cilia corresponding 
      to the photoreceptor outer segments of submammalian pinealocytes. Potassium 
      pyroantimonate cytochemistry shows a similar localization of calcium ions in the 
      mammalian pinealocyte as in the submammalian photoreceptor ones. Pineal 
      calcifications are present in some birds (goose, duck) and may be connected to the 
      photoreceptory Ca-exchange of the pineal organ. Axonic processes of pinealocytes 
      form synapses on secondary neurons in mammals (hedgehog, rat, cat). Such neurons are 
      also present in human pineals. Axons of these neurons constitute a pinealofugal 
      pathway. In the cat, some of the intrinsic pineal neurons are GABA-immunoreactive, 
      they form axodendritic and axo-axonic synapses (inhibitory?) on immunonegative 
      neurons and pinealocytes, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Characterization of two neurogenin genes from the brook lamprey lampetra planeri and 
      their expression in the lamprey nervous system.
PG  - 1096-1108
LID - 10.1002/dvdy.24273 [doi]
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Neurogenins are required for the specification of neuronal precursors 
      and regulate the expression of basic Helix-Loop-Helix genes involved in neuronal 
      differentiation. Jawed vertebrates possess three Neurogenin paralogy groups and 
      their combined expression covers the entire nervous system, apart from the autonomic 
      nervous system. RESULTS: Here we report the isolation of two Neurogenin genes, 
      LpNgnA and LpNgnB, from the lamprey Lampetra planeri. Phylogenetic analyses show 
      both genes have orthologues in other lamprey species and in a hagfish. Neither gene 
      shows evidence of orthology to specific jawed vertebrate Neurogenin paralogues. 
      LpNgnA is expressed in the ventricular zone of regions of the brain and spinal cord, 
      with expression in the brain demarcating brain sub-compartments including the 
      pallium, tegmentum, tectum, and dorsal thalamus. In the peripheral nervous system, 
      LpNgnA is expressed in cranial sensory placodes and their derivatives, and in the 
      dorsal root ganglia. LpNgnB is expressed transiently in placodal head ectoderm and 
      throughout the central nervous system in early development, and in a small 
      population cells that form part of the macula. CONCLUSIONS: Combined, LpNgnA and 
      LpNgnB were detected in most cell populations marked by Neurogenin gene expression 
      in jawed vertebrates, with the exception of the cerebellum, retina and the 
      non-neural expression sites. Developmental Dynamics 244:1096-1108, 2015. © 2015

LID - 10.1007/978-1-4939-1568-2_2 [doi]
AB  - Mast cells (MCs) are tissue-based immune cells that participate to both innate and 
      adaptive immunities as well as to tissue-remodelling processes. Their evolutionary 
      history appears as a fascinating process, whose outline we can only partly 
      reconstruct according to current remnant evidence. MCs have been identified in all 
      vertebrate classes, and a cell population with the overall characteristics of higher 
      vertebrate MCs is identifiable even in the most evolutionarily advanced fish 
      species. In invertebrates, cells related to vertebrate MCs have been recognized in 
      ascidians, a class of urochordates which appeared approximately 500 million years 
      ago. These comprise the granular hemocyte with intermediate characteristics of 
      basophils and MCs and the "test cell" (see below). Both types of cells contain 
      histamine and heparin, and provide defensive functions. The test cell releases 
      tryptase after stimulation with compound 48/80. A leukocyte ancestor operating in 
      the context of a primitive local innate immunity probably represents the MC 
      phylogenetic progenitor. This cell was likely involved in phagocytic and killing 
      activity against pathogens and operated as a general inducer of inflammation. This 
      early type of defensive cell possibly expressed concomitant tissue-reparative 
      functions. With the advent of recombinase activating gene (RAG)-mediated adaptive 
      immunity in the Cambrian era, some 550 million years ago, and the emergence of early 
      vertebrates, MC progenitors differentiated towards a more complex cellular entity. 
      Early MCs probably appeared in the last common ancestor we shared with hagfish, 
      lamprey, and sharks about 450-500 million years ago.

AB  - The variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) of lamprey and hagfish comprise 
      leucine-rich repeat modules, instead of the immunoglobulin-like domain building 
      blocks of antibodies and T-cell receptors in jawed vertebrates. Both types of 
      vertebrate-rearranging antigen receptors are similarly diverse, with repertoires 
      that can potentially exceed 10(14) unique receptors. In order to characterize 
      antigen-binding properties of the VLRs, we developed a high-throughput yeast surface 
      display platform for the isolation of monoclonal VLRs. We have isolated VLRs that 
      specifically bind hen egg lysozyme, β-galactosidase, cholera toxin subunit B, 
      R-phycoerythrin, and the blood group trisaccharides A and B, with binding affinities 
      in the mid-nanomolar to mid-picomolar range. VLRs may, thus, be excellent 
      single-chain alternatives to Ig-based antibodies for biotechnology applications.

TI  - Taste buds: development and evolution.
PG  - 198-206
AB  - The gustatory system in vertebrates comprises peripheral receptors (taste buds), 
      innervated by three cranial nerves (VII, IX, and X), and a series of central neural 
      centers and pathways. All vertebrates, with the exception of hagfishes, have taste 
      buds. These receptors vary morphologically in different vertebrates but usually 
      consist of at least four types of cells (dark, light, basal, and stem cells). An 
      out-group analysis indicates that taste buds were restricted to the oropharynx, 
      primitively, and that external taste buds, distributed over the head and, in some 
      cases, even the trunk, evolved a number of times independently. The sensory neurons 
      of the cranial nerves that innervate taste buds are believed to arise from 
      epibranchial placodes, which are induced by pharyngeal endoderm, but it has never 
      been demonstrated experimentally that these sensory neurons do, in fact, arise from 
      these placodes. Although many details of the development of the innervation of taste 
      buds are still unknown, it is now clear that taste buds are induced from either 
      ecto- or endodermal epithelia, rather than arising from either placodes or neural 
      crest. At present, there are two developmental models of taste bud induction: The 
      neural induction model claims that peripheral nerve fibers induce taste buds, 
      whereas the early specification model claims that oropharyngeal epithelium is 
      specified by or during gastrulation and that taste buds arise from cell-cell 
      interactions within the specified epithelium. There is now substantial evidence that 
      the early specification model best describes the induction of taste buds.

TI  - Feeding and breathing in lampreys.
PG  - 297-305
AB  - A basic problem faced by the agnathans in evolution was how to feed and breathe 
      without jaws. Three solutions are represented by lampreys and their ammocoete 
      larvae, reviewed here, and hagfishes. Lampreys feed upon fish with their suckers and 
      breathe in and out of their branchial gill sacs. Parasitic species of lampreys can 
      be flesh-feeders or blood-feeders, depending primarily on the structure of their 
      teeth. Feeding behavior is characterized by rhythmic rasping, negative pressure 
      pulses in the sucker, and swallowing of fluid into the gut. Ammocoete larvae use a 
      velar pump for unidirectional ventilation and suspension feeding. In both lampreys 
      and ammocoetes the branchial basket is actively compressed for exhalation; branchial 
      expansion and inhalation is by passive elastic recoil, but in ammocoetes water is 
      drawn from the mouth. Central pattern generators for respiration are distributed in 
      the medulla, particularly lateral to Vm, and drive branchial motoneurons in 
      VIIm-IXm-Xm. Trigeminal pattern generators in lampreys may be a holdover from the 
      ammocoete stage, in which they drive nearby velar motoneurons as the primary pump 
      for ventilation. Respiration in lampreys and ammocoetes is stimulated by hypoxia and 
      modulated by reflexes. Metamorphosis from ammocoete to adult lamprey involves 
      extensive remodeling of the head with regression and replacement of most muscles. 
      Trigeminal motoneurons are probably preserved during metamorphosis, as inferred from 
      constant maps of motoneurons in Vm. This hypothesis is supported by analogy with 
      anuran metamorphosis in which V motoneurons are retained and remodeled. In Mallatt's 
      current models, the earliest vertebrates breathed by branchial contractions and 
      valves; jaws initially evolved for better ventilation and later were used for 
      feeding.

TI  - Conodont affinity and chordate phylogeny.
PG  - 191-251
AB  - Current information on the conodonts Clydagnathus windsorensis (Globensky) and 
      Promissum pulchrum Kovács-Endrödy, together with the latest interpretations of 
      conodont hard tissues, are reviewed and it is concluded that sufficient evidence 
      exists to justify interpretation of the conodonts on a chordate model. A new 
      phylogenetic analysis is undertaken, consisting of 17 chordate taxa and 103 
      morphological, physiological and biochemical characters; conodonts are included as a 
      primary taxon. Various experiments with character coding, taxon deletion and the use 
      of constraint trees are carried out. We conclude that conodonts are cladistically 
      more derived than either hagfishes or lampreys because they possess a mineralised 
      dermal skeleton and that they are the most plesiomorphic member of the total group 
      Gnathostomata. We discuss the evolution of the nervous and sensory systems and the 
      skeleton in the context of our optimal phylogenetic tree. There appears to be no 
      simple evolution of free to canal-enclosed neuromasts; organised neuromasts within 
      canals appear to have arisen at least three times from free neuromasts or neuromasts 
      arranged within grooves. The mineralised vertebrate skeleton first appeared as 
      odontodes of dentine or dentine plus enamel in the paraconodont/euconodont feeding 
      apparatus. Bone appeared later, co-ordinate with the development of a dermal 
      skeleton, and it appears to have been primitively acellular. Atubular dentine is 
      more primitive than tubular dentine. However, the subsequent distribution of the 
      different types of dentine (e.g. mesodentine, orthodentine), suggests that these 
      tissue types are homoplastic. The topology of relationships and known stratigraphic 
      ranges of taxa in our phylogeny predict the existence of myxinoids and 
      petromyzontids in the Cambrian.

TI  - The mast cell: an evolutionary perspective.
PG  - 347-60
LID - 10.1111/j.1469-185X.2009.00105.x [doi]
AB  - This review article is an attempt to trace the evolution of mast cells (MCs). These 
      immune cells have been identified in all vertebrate classes as single-lobed cells 
      containing variable amounts of membrane-bound secretory granules which store a large 
      series of mediators, namely histamine, proteases, cytokines and growth factors. 
      Other MC features, at least in mammals, are the c-kit receptor for the stem cell 
      factor and the high-affinity receptor, FcepsilonRI, for immunoglobulin E (IgE). The 
      c-kit receptor also has been identified in fish MCs. The FcepsilonRI receptor seems 
      to be a more recent acquisition in MC phylogenesis given that IgE originated in 
      mammalian species. Tryptase and histamine have also been recognized in MCs of 
      teleost fish. Thus, a cell population with the overall characteristics of higher 
      vertebrate MCs is identifiable in the most evolutionarily advanced fish species. Two 
      potential MC progenitors have been identified in ascidians (urochordates which 
      appeared approximately 500 million years ago): the basophil/MC-like granular 
      haemocyte and the test cell. Both contain histamine and heparin, and provide 
      defensive functions. Some granular haemocytes in Arthropoda also closely approximate 
      the ultrastructure of modern MCs. The origin of MCs is probably to be found in a 
      leukocyte ancestor operating in the context of a primitive local innate immunity and 
      involved in phagocytic and killing activity against pathogens. From this type of 
      defensive cell, the MC phylogenetic progenitor evolved into a tissue regulatory and 
      remodelling cell, which was incorporated into the networks of recombinase activating 
      genes (RAG)-mediated adaptive immunity in the Cambrian era, some 550 million years 
      ago. Early MCs probably appeared in the last common ancestor we shared with hagfish, 
      lamprey and sharks about 450-500 million years ago.

TI  - Kinesin-related genes from diplomonad, sponge, amphioxus, and cyclostomes: 
      divergence pattern of kinesin family and evolution of giardial membrane-bounded 
      organella.
PG  - 1524-33
AB  - To understand the question of whether divergence of eukaryotic genes by gene 
      duplications and domain shufflings proceeded gradually or intermittently during 
      evolution, we have cloned and sequenced Giardia lamblia cDNAs encoding kinesins and 
      kinesin-related proteins and have obtained 13 kinesin-related cDNAs, some of which 
      are likely homologs of vertebrate kinesins involved in vesicle transfer to ER, 
      Golgi, and plasma membrane. A phylogenetic tree of the kinesin family revealed that 
      most gene duplications that gave rise to different kinesin subfamilies with distinct 
      functions have been completed before the earliest divergence of extant eukaryotes. 
      This suggests that the complex endomembrane system has arisen very early in 
      eukaryotic evolution, and the diminutive ER and Golgi apparatus recognized in the 
      giardial cells, together with the absence of mitochondria, might be characters 
      acquired secondarily during the evolution of parasitism. To understand the 
      divergence pattern of the kinesin family in the lineage leading to vertebrates, 
      seven more Unc104-related cDNAs have been cloned from sponge, amphioxus, hagfish, 
      and lamprey. The divergence pattern of the animal Unc104/KIF1 subfamily is 
      characterized by two active periods in gene duplication interrupted by a 
      considerably long period of silence, instead of proceeding gradually: animals 
      underwent extensive gene duplications before the parazoan-eumetazoan split. In the 
      early evolution of vertebrates around the cyclostome-gnathostome split, further gene 
      duplications occurred, by which a variety of genes with similar structures over the 
      entire regions were generated. This pattern of divergence is similar to those of 
      animal genes involved in cell-cell communication and developmental control.

TI  - Divergence of insulin-like growth factors I and II in the elasmobranch, Squalus 
      acanthias.
PG  - 69-72
AB  - Recent studies have shown that vertebrates, including teleostean fishes, amphibians, 
      birds and mammals, contain two distinct insulin-like growth factor (IGF) genes. In 
      contrast agnathans, represented by hagfish, apparently have only one IGF that has 
      features characteristic of both IGF-I and IGF-II. Between these groups the 
      elasmobranchs occupy a critical position in terms of the phylogeny of IGFs. We 
      sought to determine if gene duplication and divergence of IGF-I and IGF-II occurred 
      before or after divergence of elasmobranchs from other vertebrates by cloning 
      IGF-like molecules from Squalus acanthias. Our analysis shows that Squalus liver 
      produces two distinct IGF-like molecules. One has greater sequence identity to, and 
      conserved features characteristic of, known IGF-I molecules, while the other is more 
      IGF-II like. These results suggest that the prototypical IGF molecule duplicated and 
      diverged in an ancestor of the extant gnathostomes.

AB  - The brain, comprising billions of neurons and intricate neural networks, is arguably 
      the most complex organ in vertebrates. The diversity of individual neurons is 
      fundamental to the neuronal network complexity and the overall function of the 
      vertebrate brain. In jawed vertebrates, clustered protocadherins provide the 
      molecular basis for this neuronal diversity, through stochastic and combinatorial 
      expression of their various isoforms in individual neurons. Based on analyses of 
      transcriptomes from the Japanese lamprey brain and sea lamprey embryos, genome 
      assemblies of the two lampreys, and brain expressed sequence tags of the inshore 
      hagfish, we show that extant jawless vertebrates (cyclostomes) lack the clustered 
      protocadherins. Our findings indicate that the clustered protocadherins originated 
      from a nonclustered protocadherin in the jawed vertebrate ancestor, after the two 
      rounds of whole-genome duplication. In the absence of clustered protocadherins, 
      cyclostomes might have evolved novel molecules or mechanisms for generating neuronal 
      diversity which remains to be discovered.

AB  - Jawless vertebrates represented by lampreys and hagfish use variable lymphocyte 
      receptors (VLRs) as antigen receptors to mount adaptive immune responses. VLRs 
      generate diversity that is comparable to immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors by a 
      gene conversion-like mechanism, which is mediated by cytosine deaminases. Currently, 
      three types of VLRs, VLRA, VLRB, and VLRC, have been identified in lampreys. Crystal 
      structures of VLRA and VLRB in complex with antigens have been reported recently, 
      but no structural information is available for VLRC. Here, we present the first 
      crystal structure of VLRC from the Japanese lamprey (Lethenteron japonicum). Similar 
      to VLRA and VLRB, VLRC forms a typical horseshoe-like solenoid structure with a 
      variable concave surface. Strikingly, its N-terminal cap has a long loop with 
      limited sequence variability that protrudes toward the concave surface, which is the 
      putative antigen-binding surface. Furthermore, as predicted previously, its 
      C-terminal cap lacks a highly variable protruding loop that plays an important role 
      in antigen recognition by lamprey VLRA and VLRB. Recent work suggests that VLRC+ 
      lymphocytes in jawless vertebrates might be akin to γδ T cells in jawed vertebrates. 
      Structural features of lamprey VLRC described here suggest that it may recognize 
      antigens in a unique manner.

TI  - Evolutionary origins of the blood vascular system and endothelium.
PG  - 46-66
LID - 10.1111/jth.12253 [doi]
AB  - Every biological trait requires both a proximate and evolutionary explanation. The 
      field of vascular biology is focused primarily on proximate mechanisms in health and 
      disease. Comparatively little attention has been given to the evolutionary basis of 
      the cardiovascular system. Here, we employ a comparative approach to review the 
      phylogenetic history of the blood vascular system and endothelium. In addition to 
      drawing on the published literature, we provide primary ultrastructural data related 
      to the lobster, earthworm, amphioxus, and hagfish. Existing evidence suggests that 
      the blood vascular system first appeared in an ancestor of the triploblasts over 600 
      million years ago, as a means to overcome the time-distance constraints of 
      diffusion. The endothelium evolved in an ancestral vertebrate some 540-510 million 
      years ago to optimize flow dynamics and barrier function, and/or to localize immune 
      and coagulation functions. Finally, we emphasize that endothelial heterogeneity 
      evolved as a core feature of the endothelium from the outset, reflecting its role in 
      meeting the diverse needs of body tissues.

TI  - Immune related genes underpin the evolution of adaptive immunity in jawless 
      vertebrates.
PG  - 86-94
AB  - The study of immune related genes in lampreys and hagfish provides a unique 
      perspective on the evolutionary genetic underpinnings of adaptive immunity and the 
      evolution of vertebrate genomes. Separated from their jawed cousins at the stem of 
      the vertebrate lineage, these jawless vertebrates have many of the gene families and 
      gene regulatory networks associated with the defining morphological and 
      physiological features of vertebrates. These include genes vital for innate 
      immunity, inflammation, wound healing, protein degradation, and the development, 
      signaling and trafficking of lymphocytes. Jawless vertebrates recognize antigen by 
      using leucine-rich repeat (LRR) based variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs), which 
      are very different from the immunoglobulin (Ig) based T cell receptor (TCR) and B 
      cell receptor (BCR) used for antigen recognition by jawed vertebrates. The 
      somatically constructed VLR genes are expressed in monoallelic fashion by T-like and 
      B-like lymphocytes. Jawless and jawed vertebrates thus share many of the genes that 
      provide the molecular infrastructure and physiological context for adaptive immune 
      responses, yet use entirely different genes and mechanisms of combinatorial assembly 
      to generate diverse repertoires of antigen recognition receptors.

TI  - Phylogeny of Tec family kinases identification of a premetazoan origin of Btk, Bmx, 
      Itk, Tec, Txk, and the Btk regulator SH3BP5.
PG  - 51-80
LID - 10.1016/S0065-2660(08)00803-1 [doi]
AB  - It is generally considered mammals and birds have five Tec family kinases (TFKs): 
      Btk, Bmx (also known as Etk), Itk, Tec, and Txk (also known as Rlk). Here, we 
      discuss the domains and their functions and regulation in TFKs. Over the last few 
      years, a large number of genomes from various phyla have been sequenced making it 
      possible to study evolutionary relationships at the molecular and sequence level. 
      Using bioinformatics tools, we for the first time demonstrate that a TFK ancestor 
      exists in the unicellular choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis, which is the 
      closest known relative to metazoans with a sequenced genome. The analysis of the 
      genomes for sponges, insects, hagfish, and frogs suggests that these species encode 
      a single TFK. The insect form has a divergent and unique N-terminal region. 
      Duplications generating the five members took place prior to the emergence of 
      vertebrates. Fishes have two or three forms and the platypus, Ornithorhynchus 
      anatinus, has four (lacks Txk). Thus, not all mammals have all five TFKs. The single 
      identified TFK in frogs is an ortholog of Tec. Bmx seems to be unique to mammals and 
      birds. SH3BP5 is a negative regulator of Btk. It is conserved in choanoflagellates 
      and interestingly exists also in nematodes, which do not express TFKs, suggesting a 
      broader function in addition to Btk regulation. The related SH3BP5-like protein is 
      not found in Nematodes.

TI  - Polypeptide YY- and neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive cells and nerves in the endocrine 
      and exocrine pancreas of some vertebrates: an onto- and phylogenetic study.
PG  - 111-7
AB  - The occurrence of polypeptide YY- and neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive cells and nerves 
      in the pancreas of some species from all the eight main vertebrate groups 
      (cyclostomes, cartilaginous fish, bony fish, amphibia, reptiles, birds, and mammals) 
      was investigated. In addition, an ontogenetic study of these neurohormonal peptides 
      was performed, using the rat pancreas. The distribution of these two peptides was 
      compared with that of the structurally closely related pancreatic polypeptide. 
      Polypeptide YY-immunoreactive cells were found to occur in the endocrine pancreas 
      and neuropeptide Y-immunoreactivity was observed both in neurons and nerve fibres. 
      The polypeptide YY-immunoreactive cells were limited to mammals and reptiles only. 
      Neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive neurons and nerves were observed in reptiles, birds, 
      and mammals only. One reptilian species (out of three) and one mammalian (out of 
      six) failed to show any kind of immunoreactivity for the polypeptide or 
      neuropeptide. Pancreatic polypeptide-immunoreactive cells were found in all the 
      species examined except in the hagfish islet. In rat foetuses, polypeptide 
      YY-immunoreactive cells and neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive nerve elements were first 
      demonstrated at the seventeenth day of gestation, whereas pancreatic 
      peptide-immunoreactive cells did not appear until postnatally, namely in two day-old 
      rats. The polypeptide-containing cells, a new cell type in the endocrine pancreas, 
      are rare. In contrast to the pancreatic peptide cells, they do not seem to have any 
      kind of regional distribution.

TI  - Expression and interaction of muscle-related genes in the lamprey imply the 
      evolutionary scenario for vertebrate skeletal muscle, in association with the 
      acquisition of the neck and fins.
PG  - 217-27

AB  - Gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates) possess skeletal muscles with unique functional and 
      developmental features that are absent from cyclostomes-i.e., lamprey and hagfish. 
      These gnathostome-specific traits include the epaxial and hypaxial division of 
      myotomes, paired fin/limb muscles, shoulder girdle muscles, and the muscle 
      associated with the tongue and the neck. Many of these muscles are derived from 
      several rostral somites, specifically from their hypaxial myotomic domains. However, 
      it has not been clarified how the complicated morphology of these muscles was 
      acquired in the evolution of vertebrates. Here we describe the expression of lamprey 
      homologs of transcription factor genes, including a myogenic regulatory factor of 
      the Myod family (MRF), Pax3/7, Lbx, and Zic, which play important roles in the 
      development of ep-/hypaxial somitic muscles in gnathostomes, and show that the 
      ventral portion of lamprey somites is comparable to the ventral dermomyotome in 
      gnathostomes. The supra- and infraoptic muscles, derived from the two anterior 
      somites in the lamprey, are molecularly specified before their extensive invasion 
      into the head region. Of these, the infraoptic myotomes are suggested to represent 
      the cucullaris homologue in the lamprey based on their topographical position in the 
      embryonic pattern. Slightly caudal myotomes in the lamprey give rise to the 
      hypobranchial muscle, the developmental homologue of the gnathostome hypobranchial 
      musculature. The dorsal moieties of the lamprey somites express a Zic gene, which in 
      teleosts specifies the epaxial identities of the somites. These evidences suggest 
      that, although the myotomes in the ancestral jawless vertebrates do not exhibit 
      ep-/hypaxial distinction at the morphological level, their dorsoventral 
      specification would have already been present at gene regulatory levels, prior to 
      the cyclostome-gnathostome divergence, which may have functioned as the key 
      innovation to establish the ep-/hypaxial distinction in gnathostomes.

TI  - Cyclostome and chondrichthyan adrenomedullins reveal ancestral features of the 
      adrenomedullin family.
PG  - 317-25
LID - 10.1016/j.cbpb.2009.07.006 [doi]
AB  - The adrenomedullin (AM) family is a newly identified group of regulatory peptides 
      involved in various aspects of homeostasis. Different forms of AMs are the result of 
      genome duplication during vertebrate evolution, but nothing is known about the AM 
      genes before divergence of bony fish. In the present study, we identified novel AM 
      genes in cyclostomes (a hagfish and two lamprey species) and chondrichthyes (a 
      holocephalan and two elasmobranch species). The AM of cyclostomes possessed features 
      of both AM1 and AM2, with gene structure and overall precursor sequence more similar 
      to AM1 of teleosts and tetrapods but mature sequence more similar to AM2. A sequence 
      reminiscent of proAM N-terminal 20 peptide (PAMP), another bioactive peptide present 
      in the prosegment of AM1 precursors, exists in the lamprey AM precursor. An AM gene 
      with both AM1 and AM2 characteristics was also found in chondrichthyes, and an 
      additional AM5-like gene was detected in Squalus acanthias. The hybrid-type AM gene 
      from cyclostomes and chondrichthyes was expressed ubiquitously in all tissues 
      examined including the skeletal muscle, while the Squalus AM5-like gene transcripts 
      were detected more specifically in the liver. Taken together, the ancestral gene of 
      the AM family appears to possess both AM1 and AM2 characteristics as observed in the 
      lamprey AM gene, and the general structure including PAMP was retained by the extant 
      AM1 genes, but the mature sequence was retained by the extant AM2 genes.

TI  - Antibody responses of variable lymphocyte receptors in the lamprey.
PG  - 319-27
LID - 10.1038/ni1562 [doi]
AB  - Lamprey and hagfish, the living representatives of jawless vertebrates, use genomic 
      leucine-rich-repeat cassettes for the combinatorial assembly of diverse antigen 
      receptor genes encoding variable lymphocyte receptors of two types: VLRA and VLRB. 
      We describe here the VLRB-bearing lineage of lymphocytes in sea lamprey. These cells 
      responded to repetitive carbohydrate or protein determinants on bacteria or 
      mammalian cells with lymphoblastoid transformation, proliferation and 
      differentiation into plasmacytes that secreted multimeric antigen-specific VLRB 
      antibodies. Lacking a thymus and the ability to respond to soluble protein antigens, 
      lampreys seem to have evolved a B cell-like system for adaptive humoral responses.

TI  - Molecular cloning of proopiomelanocortin cDNA in the ratfish, a holocephalan.
PG  - 159-65
AB  - Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) is a precursor for several pituitary hormones including 
      adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) and endorphin 
      (END). Fish POMCs in four taxonomic classes, Cephalaspidomorphi (lampreys), 
      Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish), Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fish), and 
      Actinopterygii (ray-finned fish) have been identified. However, two essential 
      species, ratfish in Chondrichthyes and hagfish in Agnatha, are still missing in the 
      evolutionary image of this molecule. The present study reports analysis of POMC cDNA 
      in the ratfish, Chimaera phantasma, which belongs to another subclass in the 
      Chondrichthyes. Partial cDNA clones were amplified by PCR from single-strand cDNA 
      prepared on total RNA from a complex of pituitary and hypothalamus, and subsequently 
      overlapped to obtain a full-length sequence. Ratfish POMC cDNA consists of 1294bp 
      excluding the poly(A) tail. It encodes a signal peptide of 25 amino acids and POMC 
      of 300 amino acids. gamma-MSH, ACTH, alpha-MSH, delta-MSH, beta-MSH, and beta-END 
      are located at prePOMC (76-87), (120-158), (120-132), (212-227), (275-290), and 
      (293-325), respectively. delta-MSH, originally found in elasmobranch POMCs, was also 
      present in ratfish POMC, suggesting this structure might have appeared after the 
      divergence of chondrichthians from the ancestral lineage. Thus, we demonstrated the 
      common occurrence of four MSHs in chondrichthian POMC and established a clear 
      understanding of the molecular evolution of POMC in gnathostomes.

TI  - Mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation in elasmobranchs.
PG  - R756-62
AB  - In heart and red muscle of dogfish (Squalus acanthias), the maximal activities of 
      the fatty acid catabolizing enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) are less 
      than 5% the rate in the same tissues of teleosts (carp, Cyprinus carpio; trout, 
      Salmo gairdneri). CPT activities in these tissues of hagfish (Eptatretus stouti) are 
      approximately 10% the rate in teleosts. However, the maximal activities of the 
      beta-oxidation enzyme beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD) in dogfish red 
      muscle and heart are similar to these tissues in the other species. This paradox 
      prompted a more detailed study on the capacity of mitochondria from dogfish cardiac 
      and red skeletal muscles to utilize fatty acids, possibly by a CPT-independent 
      pathway. Free fatty acids were not oxidized by mitochondria from red muscle 
      (hexanoate, octanoate, decanoate, and palmitate) or from heart (octanoate, 
      palmitate). Neither hyposmotic incubation nor addition of 5 mM ATP could stimulate 
      oxidation of octanoate or palmitate in either preparation, suggesting that these 
      tissues have little capacity to oxidize fatty acids by a carnitine-independent 
      pathway. Palmitoyl carnitine oxidation was detectable at very low rates in these 
      mitochondria only with hyposmotic incubation. Octanoyl carnitine was oxidized at 
      greater rates than palmitoyl carnitine, 10% the rate of pyruvate in both tissues, 
      suggesting that medium-chain fatty acids could be physiologically relevant fuels in 
      elasmobranchs if available to heart and red muscle. One potential source of 
      medium-chain fatty acids is hepatic peroxisomal beta-oxidation, which occurs in 
      dogfish liver at maximal activities similar to carp and trout liver. However, based 
      on relative rates of oxidation, it is likely that dogfish heart and red muscle 
      metabolism are fueled primarily by carbohydrate and ketone bodies.

TI  - Isolation and structure of lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) insulin.
PG  - 46-55
AB  - Insulin has been purified to homogeneity from the caudal and cranial pancreas of the 
      adult sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus). The final yield was 18.6 nmol/g (127.8 
      micrograms/g). The structures of both A- and B-chains have been determined using 
      amino acid analyses, gas-phase sequence analyses, and proteolytic mapping by fast 
      atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. The sequence of the A-chain was found to be 
      GIVEQCCHRKCSIYDMENYCN. The sequence of the B-chain, extended at the amino terminus, 
      was determined to be SALT-GAGGTHLCGSHLVEALYVVCGDRGFFYTPSKT. Lamprey insulin retains 
      the common features of vertebrate insulins. Sea lamprey insulin has no more homology 
      to hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) insulin than it has to the teleost fish or to 
      mammalian insulins.

      inhibition of lipolysis were studied simultaneously by using rat adipocytes to 
      determine whether these different effects of insulin are mediated through the same 
      or different sets of receptors. 2. The sensitivity (defined as the concentration of 
      insulin required to produce a half-maximal effect) of the stimulated lipogenic 
      response to insulin was not significantly different from the sensitivity of the 
      anti-lipolytic response to insulin. The addition of different adrenaline and glucose 
      concentrations did not alter the half-maximal concentration of insulin required to 
      inhibit lipolysis. 3. The specificities of the lipogenic and antilipolytic responses 
      were studied by using insulin analogues. The sensitivities of the lipogenic and 
      anti-lipolytic responses were the same for five chemically modified insulins and 
      hagfish insulin, which have potencies compared with bovine insulin of between 3 and 
      90%. 4. Starving rats for 48h significantly increased the sensitivities of both the 
      antilipolytic and lipogenic responses to insulin, but the changes in the 
      sensitivities of both lipogenesis and anti-lipolysis returned to that of fed rats. 
      5. We conclude that insulin stimulates lipogenesis and inhibits lipolysis over the 
      same concentration range. These observations provide powerful evidence that the 
      different effects of insulin are mediated through the same set of receptors.

AB  - Alarm signals released after predator attack function as reliable public information 
      revealing areas of high risk. The utility of this information can extend beyond 
      species boundaries, benefiting heterospecifics capable of recognizing and responding 
      appropriately to the signal. Nonmutually exclusive hypotheses explaining the 
      acquisition of heterospecific reactivity to cues suggest it could be conserved 
      phylogenetically following its evolution in a common ancestor (a species-level 
      effect) and/or learned during periods of shared risk (a population-level effect; 
      e.g., shared predators). Using a laboratory-based space-use behavioral assay, we 
      tested the response of sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) to the damage-released alarm 
      cues of five confamilial (sympatric and allopatric) species and two distantly 
      related out-groups: a sympatric teleost (white sucker Catostomus commersonii) and an 
      allopatric agnathan (Atlantic hagfish Myxine glutinosa). We found that sea lamprey 
      differed in their response to conspecific and heterospecific odors; exhibiting 
      progressively weaker avoidance of cues derived from more phylogenetically distant 
      confamilials regardless of current overlap in distribution. Odors from out-groups 
      elicited no response. These findings suggest that a damage-released alarm cue is at 
      least partially conserved within the Petromyzontidae and that sea lamprey perceives 
      predator attacks directed to closely related taxa. These findings are consistent 
      with similar observations from gastropod, amphibian and bony fish taxa, and we 
      discuss this in an eco-evo context to provide a plausible explanation for the 
      acquisition and maintenance of the response in sea lamprey.

AB  - This mini review summarizes the current knowledge of the 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) endocrine system in lampreys, jawless 
      vertebrates. Lampreys and hagfish are the only two extant members of the class of 
      agnathans, the oldest lineage of vertebrates. The high conservation of the 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis in lampreys makes the lamprey model highly 
      appropriate for comparative and evolutionary analyses. However, there are still many 
      unknown questions concerning the hypothalamic-pituitary (HP) axis in its regulation 
      of thyroid activities in lampreys. As an example, the hypothalamic and pituitary 
      hormone(s) that regulate the HPT axis have not been confirmed and/or characterized. 
      Similar to gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates), lampreys produce thyroxine (T4) and 
      triiodothyronine (T3) from thyroid follicles that are suggested to be involved in 
      larval development, metamorphosis, and reproduction. The existing data provide 
      evidence of a primitive, overlapping yet functional HPG and HPT endocrine system in 
      lamprey. We hypothesize that lampreys are in an evolutionary intermediate stage of 
      hypothalamic-pituitary development, leading to the emergence of the highly 
      specialized HPG and HPT endocrine axes in jawed vertebrates. Study of the ancient 
      lineage of jawless vertebrates, the agnathans, is key to understanding the origins 
      of the neuroendocrine system in vertebrates.

TI  - Lamprey variable lymphocyte receptors mediate complement-dependent cytotoxicity.
PG  - 922-30
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1200876 [doi]
AB  - An alternative adaptive-immune system is present in the most basal 
      vertebrates--lampreys and hagfish--the only surviving jawless vertebrates. These 
      eel-like fish use leucine-rich repeat-based receptors for Ag recognition instead of 
      the Ig-based receptors used in jawed vertebrates. We report that in Japanese lamprey 
      (Lampetra japonica), variable lymphocyte receptor (VLR)B interacts with C1q and C3 
      proteins to mediate complement-dependent cytotoxicity for bacteria and tumor cells. 
      The immune-based lysis involves deposition of VLRB and C1q-like protein complex on 
      the surface of target cells, activation of C3, and ultimate disruption of cell wall 
      integrity. The demonstration of functional interaction between VLRB and complement 
      components in lamprey provides evidence for the emergence of cooperative innate and 
      adaptive-immune responses at a pivotal point in vertebrate evolution, before or in 
      parallel with the evolution of Ig-based Abs and the classical complement-activation 
      pathway.

TI  - The salmonid cathelicidins: a gene family with highly varied C-terminal 
      antimicrobial domains.
PG  - 376-81
LID - 10.1016/j.cbpb.2009.01.003 [doi]
AB  - The cathelicidin family of host defence peptides is regarded as an important 
      component of the host innate immune system. Its members have been found in mammals, 
      birds, primitive vertebrate Atlantic hagfish and, most recently, also in ray-finned 
      fish such as rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon. By using genomic PCR amplifications 
      and RT-PCR tissue analyses we have here investigated and characterized the 
      cathelicidin gene family in three salmonids: brown trout (Salmo trutta fario), brook 
      trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and grayling (Thymallus thymallus). One or two 
      different genes were found in each species coding for almost identical cathelin-like 
      domains and largely varied cationic C-terminal regions. Multiple alignment of the 
      amino acid sequences let us recognize two distinctive hallmarks of these peptides: 
      the presence of a high number of serine and glycine residues, which may collocate 
      them in a new class of antimicrobial peptides, and of the six-amino-acid repeated 
      sequence RPGGGS detected in a variable number of copies among different 
      cathelicidins. The high variation in length and sequence of this region suggests the 
      existence of a genetically unstable region similar to that found in some mammalian 
      cathelicidins.

TI  - Towards understanding the role of insulin in the brain: lessons from insulin-related 
      signaling systems in the invertebrate brain.
PG  - 35-54
AB  - Insulin is a molecule that has played a key role in several of the most important 
      landmarks in medical and biological research. It is one of the most extensively 
      studied protein hormones, and its structure and function have been elucidated in 
      many vertebrate species, ranging from man to hagfish and turkey. The structure, 
      function as well as tissue of synthesis of vertebrate insulins are strictly 
      conserved. The structural identification of insulin-related peptides from 
      invertebrates has disrupted the picture of an evolutionary stable peptide hormone. 
      Insulin-related peptides in molluscs and insects turned out to be a structurally 
      diverse group encoded by large multi-gene families that are uniquely expressed in 
      the brain and serve functions different from vertebrate insulin. In this review, we 
      discuss invertebrate insulins in detail. We examine how these peptides relate to the 
      model role that vertebrate insulin has played over the years; however, more 
      importantly, we discuss several unique principles that can be learned from them. We 
      show how diversity of these peptides is generated at the genetic level and how the 
      structural diversity of the peptides is linked to the exclusive presence of a single 
      type of neuronal insulin receptor-related receptor. We also discuss the fact that 
      the invertebrate peptides, in addition to a hormonal role, may also act in a 
      synaptic and/or nonsynaptic fashion as transmitters/neuromodulators on neurons in 
      the brain. It can be expected that the use of well-defined neuronal preparations in 
      invertebrates may lead to a further understanding of these novel functions and may 
      act as guide preparations for a possible role of insulin and its relatives in the 
      vertebrate brain.

TI  - Phylogenetical aspects on islet hormone families: a minireview with particular 
      reference to insulin as a growth factor and to the phylogeny of PYY and NPY 
      immunoreactive cells and nerves in the endocrine and exocrine pancreas.
PG  - 315-20
AB  - A common feature in the phylogeny of the four islet hormones (insulin, somatostatin, 
      glucagon, PP) is that they do not seem to occur in the most primitive metazoan 
      animals investigated so far, namely the coelenterates. However, already in the 
      earliest protostomian invertebrates, such as flatworms and annelids, somatostatin 
      and PP immunoreactive nerve fibres were found. In highly developed forms of 
      protostomian invertebrates, such as insects, all the four islet hormones are 
      represented as immunoreactive nerve cells and nerve fibres in the brain. In 
      deuterostomian invertebrates a brain-gut-axis has evolved as regards somatostatin 
      and PP, whereas insulin and glucagon now seem to occur exclusively as cells of open 
      type in the gut mucosa. This brain-gut-axis for somatostatin and PP persists in all 
      the vertebrates. The insulin cells, however, leave the gut mucosa already in the 
      earliest forms of vertebrates and then appear only as cells in the islet parenchyma 
      and in the mucosa of the bile duct (Agnatha) or in the pancreatic ducts 
      (Gnathostomi). To some extent, glucagon islet cells evolve in a similar manner; 
      here, however, cells immunoreactive with the precursor hormone, glicentin 
      (enteroglucagon), persist in the gastrointestinal tract mucosa. A few PYY 
      immunoreactive cells have been found in the pancreatic islet parenchyma of reptiles 
      and mammals, often as disseminated cells in the acinar tissue. In the pancreas of 
      these phyla NPY only occurs in neurons and nerve fibres. In pilot studies the 
      effects of hagfish insulin as a growth factor have been compared with those of pig 
      insulin on Swiss 3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblasts.

TI  - Development and evolution of the vertebrate primary mouth.
PG  - 79-99
LID - 10.1111/j.1469-7580.2012.01540.x [doi]
AB  - The vertebrate oral region represents a key interface between outer and inner 
      environments, and its structural and functional design is among the limiting factors 
      for survival of its owners. Both formation of the respective oral opening (primary 
      mouth) and establishment of the food-processing apparatus (secondary mouth) require 
      interplay between several embryonic tissues and complex embryonic rearrangements. 
      Although many aspects of the secondary mouth formation, including development of the 
      jaws, teeth or taste buds, are known in considerable detail, general knowledge about 
      primary mouth formation is regrettably low. In this paper, primary mouth formation 
      is reviewed from a comparative point of view in order to reveal its underestimated 
      morphogenetic diversity among, and also within, particular vertebrate clades. In 
      general, three main developmental modes were identified. The most common is 
      characterized by primary mouth formation via a deeply invaginated ectodermal 
      stomodeum and subsequent rupture of the bilaminar oral membrane. However, in 
      salamander, lungfish and also in some frog species, the mouth develops alternatively 
      via stomodeal collar formation contributed both by the ecto- and endoderm. In 
      ray-finned fishes, on the other hand, the mouth forms via an ectoderm wedge and 
      later horizontal detachment of the initially compressed oral epithelia with probably 
      a mixed germ-layer derivation. A very intriguing situation can be seen in agnathan 
      fishes: whereas lampreys develop their primary mouth in a manner similar to the most 
      common gnathostome pattern, hagfishes seem to undergo a unique oropharyngeal 
      morphogenesis when compared with other vertebrates. In discussing the early 
      formative embryonic correlates of primary mouth formation likely to be responsible 
      for evolutionary-developmental modifications of this area, we stress an essential 
      role of four factors: first, positioning and amount of yolk tissue; closely related 
      to, second, endoderm formation during gastrulation, which initiates the process and 
      constrains possible evolutionary changes within this area; third, incipient 
      structure of the stomodeal primordium at the anterior neural plate border, where the 
      ectoderm component of the prospective primary mouth is formed; and fourth, the prime 
      role of Pitx genes for establishment and later morphogenesis of oral region both in 
      vertebrates and non-vertebrate chordates.

TI  - The acquisition of myelin: a success story.
PG  - 15-21; discussion 21-5, 54-7, 275-81
AB  - The myelin sheath, and hence the myelin-forming cells (i.e. Schwann cells in the PNS 
      and oligodendrocytes in the CNS), have been a crucial acquisition of vertebrates. 
      The major function of myelin is to increase the velocity of propagation of nerve 
      impulses. Invertebrate axons are ensheathed by glial cells, but do not have a 
      compact myelin. As a consequence, action potentials along invertebrate axons 
      propagate at about 1 m/s, or less. This is sufficient, however, for the survival of 
      small animals (between 0.1 and 30cm). Among invertebrates, only the cephalopods are 
      larger. By increasing their axonal diameter to 1 mm or more, cephalopods have been 
      able to increase the speed of propagation of action potentials and therefore adapt 
      nerve conduction to their larger body size. However, due to the physical constraint 
      imposed by the skull and vertebrae, vertebrates had to find an alternative solution. 
      This was achieved by introducing the myelin sheath, which leads action potentials to 
      propagate at speeds of 50-100m/s without increasing the diameter of their axons. Not 
      all vertebrate axons, however, are myelinated. In the protovertebrates (lancelets, 
      hagfishes, lampreys), which belong to the agnathes (jawless fishes), axons are not 
      ensheathed by myelin. Among living vertebrates, the most ancient myelinated species 
      are the cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays), suggesting that acquisition of myelin 
      is concomitant with the acquisition of a hinged-jaw, i.e. the gnathostoma. The close 
      association between the apparition of a hinged-jaw and the myelin sheath has led to 
      speculation that among the devonian fishes that have disappeared today, the jawless 
      conodonts and ostracoderms were not myelinated, and that myelin was first acquired 
      by the oldest gnathostomes: the placoderms. I also question where myelin first 
      appeared: the PNS, the CNS or both? I provide evidence that, in fact, it is not the 
      type of myelin-forming cell that is crucial, but the appearance of axonal signals, 
      rendering axons receptive to inducing an ensheathing glial cell to wrap around the 
      axon. Under certain circumstances or in some species, invertebrate ensheathing glial 
      cells wrap around axon to form a pseudo-myelin sheath. Therefore, to form myelin it 
      was not compulsory to 'invent' a new cell type. Hence my conclusion that myelination 
      has most probably started simultaneously in the PNS and the CNS, using pre-existing 
      ensheathing glial cells.

TI  - Cranial and spinal nerve organization in amphioxus and lampreys: evidence for an 
      ancestral craniate pattern.
PG  - 96-109
AB  - The spinal nerves in amphioxus are compared with the spinal and cranial nerves in 
      lampreys. The dorsal spinal roots in amphioxus are similar to the mixed sensory and 
      motor dorsal roots of many cranial nerves in lampreys but not to the purely sensory 
      dorsal spinal roots in lampreys and gnathostomes. Likewise, cranial nerves V, VII, 
      IX and X in lampreys, and all spinal nerves in amphioxus, lack a separate ventral 
      motor root which is a constant feature of all spinal motor roots in lampreys and 
      other vertebrates. Based on these similarities and differences, it is proposed that 
      cranial and spinal nerves in craniates are independently derived serial homologs of 
      elements of an amphioxus-like ancestral pattern. Further evolution involved the 
      addition of neural crest-derived ganglia to most cranial and all spinal nerves, and 
      the addition of placodally derived ganglia to many cranial nerves. The possible 
      homology of ocular motor nerves is discussed but cannot be resolved owing to the 
      absence of these nerves in hagfishes, which are the only relevant outgroup.

TI  - Immunochemical cross-reactivity ofβ-naphthoflavone-inducible cytochrome P450 
      (P450IA) in liver microsomes from different fish species and rat.
PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.1007/BF01987606 [doi]
AB  - Antibodies prepared against the major β-naphthoflavone (BNF)-inducible cytochrome 
      P450 (P450) forms from three species of fish (rainbow trout, Atlantic cod, and scup) 
      well separated in teleost phylogeny, were used to investigate the immunochemical 
      relatedness of liver microsomal P450 in different species of BNF-treated fish and 
      rat. Rabbit polyclonal IgG against all three P450s and mouse monoclonal antibodies 
      prepared against scup P450E were employed in this study. Liver microsomes were 
      prepared from BNF-treated specimens of hagfish, herring, rainbow trout, cod, scup, 
      perch, plaice and rat. With Western blotting it was shown that the various 
      antibodies cross-reacted with a protein band in liver microsomes in the P450-region 
      of each of the BNF-treated fish species. The apparent molecular weight of the 
      cross-reacting proteins showed differences within the range 54,000-59,000 daltons. 
      The effects of the different antibodies on the microsomal BNF-inducible 
      7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity gave inhibition patterns that 
      reflected to a certain extent the phylogenetic relationship of the species 
      investigated. In rat microsomes a protein band of relative molecular mass similar to 
      rat P450c (Mr=54,000) was recognized by all antibodies. In addition, a second band 
      of lower molecular mass was strongly recognized by anti-cod P450c antibodies, and 
      faintly stained with anti-rainbow trout P450LM4b IgG and anti-scup P450E MAb 1-12-3. 
      This band could correspond to rat P450d, the isosafrole-inducible rat isoenzyme. 
      Considering the long separate evolutionary history of some of these fishes (50-200 
      million years), the results demonstrate that certain antigenic epitopes in the 
      BNF-inducible P450 isoenzymes have been strongly conserved during the evolution of 
      fish species. These conserved epitopes seem however not to be directly involved in 
      the measured EROD activities. Furthermore, the results suggest that the 
      BNF-inducible P450s in fish contain regions with structural similarity to the 
      homologous counterpart that has evolved through gene duplication into a P450 family 
      in mammals containing at least two gene products (the P450IA gene family).

AB  - Lampreys and hagfish are primitive jawless vertebrates capable of mounting specific 
      immune responses. Lampreys possess different types of lymphocytes, akin to T and B 
      cells of jawed vertebrates, that clonally express somatically diversified antigen 
      receptors termed variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs), which are composed of tandem 
      arrays of leucine-rich repeats. The VLRs appear to be diversified by a gene 
      conversion mechanism involving lineage-specific cytosine deaminases. VLRA is 
      expressed on the surface of T-like lymphocytes; B-like lymphocytes express and 
      secrete VLRB as a multivalent protein. VLRC is expressed by a distinct lymphocyte 
      lineage. VLRA-expressing cells appear to develop in a thymus-like tissue at the tip 
      of gill filaments, and VLRB-expressing cells develop in hematopoietic tissues. 
      Reciprocal expression patterns of evolutionarily conserved interleukins and 
      chemokines possibly underlie cell-cell interactions during an immune response. The 
      discovery of VLRs in agnathans illuminates the origins of adaptive immunity in early 
      vertebrates.

AB  - We herein review all published molecular studies (life history, taxonomy, and 
      phylogeny) and summarize all GenBank sequences and primer sets for the "fish blood 
      flukes". Further, by analysing new and all available sequence data for the partial 
      D1-D2 domains of 28S from 83 blood fluke taxa, we explore the evolutionary expansion 
      of flatworm parasitism in the blood of craniates. Based on this analysis, the blood 
      flukes infecting marine bony fishes (Euteleostei) are monophyletic. The clade 
      comprising the chondrichthyan blood fluke plus the marine euteleost blood flukes is 
      the sister group to tetrapod blood flukes (spirorchiids and schistosomes). The 
      innominate blood fluke cercariae from freshwater gastropods were monophyletic and 
      sister to the clade comprising spirorchiids and schistosomes, but low nodal support 
      indicated that they may represent a distinct blood fluke lineage with phylogenetic 
      affinities also to fish blood flukes. Blood flukes that utilize gastropod 
      intermediate hosts were monophyletic (unidentified gastropod cercariae+tetrapod 
      blood flukes) and those utilizing bivalves and polychaetes were monophyletic (marine 
      fish blood flukes). Low or no taxon sampling among blood flukes of basal fish 
      lineages and primary division freshwater fish lineages are significant data gaps 
      needing closure. We also note that no record of an infection exists in a hagfish 
      (Myxiniformes), lamprey (Petromyzontiformes), or nontetrapod sarcopterygiian, i.e., 
      coelacanth (Coelacanthimorpha) or lungfish (Dipnoi). The present phylogenetic 
      analysis reiterated support for monophyly of Schistosomatidae and paraphyly of 
      spirorchiids, with the blood flukes of freshwater turtles basal to those of marine 
      turtles and schistosomes.

TI  - Evolution of the insulin molecule: insights into structure-activity and phylogenetic 
      relationships.
PG  - 1183-93
AB  - The conformation of insulin in the crystalline state has been known for more than 30 
      years but there remains uncertainty regarding the biologically active conformation 
      and the structural features that constitute the receptor-binding domain. The primary 
      structure of insulin has been determined for at least 100 vertebrate species. In 
      addition to the invariant cysteines, only ten amino acids (GlyA1, IleA2, ValA3, 
      TyrA19, LeuB6, GlyB8, LeuB11, ValB12, GlyB23 and PheB24) have been fully conserved 
      during vertebrate evolution. This observation supports the hypothesis derived from 
      alanine-scanning mutagenesis studies that five of these invariant residues (IleA2, 
      ValA3, TyrA19, GlyB23, and Phe24) interact directly with the receptor and five 
      additional conserved residues (LeuB6, GlyB8, LeuB11, GluB13 and PheB25) are 
      important in maintaining the receptor-binding conformation. With the exception of 
      the hagfish, only conservative substitutions are found at B13 (Glu --> Asp) and 
      B25(Phe --> Tyr). In contrast, amino acid residues that were also considered to be 
      important in receptor binding based upon the crystal structure of insulin (GluA4, 
      GlnA5, AsnA21, TyrB16, TyrB26) have been much less well conserved and are probably 
      not components of the receptor-binding domain. The hypothesis that LeuA13 and LeuB17 
      form part of a second receptor-binding site in the insulin molecule finds some 
      support in terms of their conservation during vertebrate evolution, although the 
      site is probably absent in some hystricomorph insulins. In general, the amino acid 
      sequences of insulins are not useful in cladistic analyses especially when 
      evolutionary distant taxa are compared but, among related species in a particular 
      order or family, the presence of unusual structural features in the insulin molecule 
      may permit a meaningful phylogenetic inference. For example, analysis of insulin 
      sequences supports monophyletic status for Dipnoi, Elasmobranchii, Holocephali and 
      Petromyzontiformes.

AB  - The enzyme soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) is the most recently identified source of 
      the messenger molecule cyclic adenosine monophosphate. sAC is evolutionarily 
      conserved from cyanobacteria to human, is directly stimulated by [Formula: see text] 
      ions, and can act as a sensor of environmental and metabolic CO(2), pH, and 
      [Formula: see text] levels. sAC genes tend to have multiple alternative promoters, 
      undergo extensive alternative splicing, be translated into low mRNA levels, and the 
      numerous sAC protein isoforms may be present in various subcellular localizations. 
      In aquatic organisms, sAC has been shown to mediate various functions including 
      intracellular pH regulation in coral, blood acid/base regulation in shark, heart 
      beat rate in hagfish, and NaCl absorption in fish intestine. Furthermore, sAC is 
      present in multiple other species and tissues, and sAC protein and enzymatic 
      activity have been reported in the cytoplasm, the nucleus, and other subcellular 
      compartments, suggesting even more diverse physiological roles. Although the methods 
      and experimental tools used to study sAC are conventional, the complexity of sAC 
      genes and proteins requires special considerations that are discussed in this 
      chapter.

AB  - Lampreys are a group of jawless fishes that serve as an important point of 
      comparison for studies of vertebrate evolution. Lampreys and hagfishes are agnathan 
      fishes, the cyclostomes, which sit at a crucial phylogenetic position as the only 
      living sister group of the jawed vertebrates. Comparisons between cyclostomes and 
      jawed vertebrates can help identify shared derived (i.e. synapomorphic) traits that 
      might have been inherited from ancestral early vertebrates, if unlikely to have 
      arisen convergently by chance. One example of a uniquely vertebrate trait is the 
      neural crest, an embryonic tissue that produces many cell types crucial to 
      vertebrate features, such as the craniofacial skeleton, pigmentation of the skin, 
      and much of the peripheral nervous system (Gans and Northcutt, 1983). Invertebrate 
      chordates arguably lack unambiguous neural crest homologs, yet have cells with some 
      similarities, making comparisons with lampreys and jawed vertebrates essential for 
      inferring characteristics of development in early vertebrates, and how they may have 
      evolved from nonvertebrate chordates. Here we review recent research on cyclostome 
      neural crest development, including research on lamprey gene regulatory networks and 
      differentiated neural crest fates.

LID - 462
AB  - Water channels (aquaporins) were originally discovered in mammals with fourteen 
      subfamilies now identified (AQP0-13). Here we show that a functional Aqp14 subfamily 
      phylogenetically related to AQP4-type channels exists in all vertebrate lineages 
      except hagfishes and eutherian mammals. In contrast to the water-selective classical 
      aquaporins, which have four aromatic-arginine constriction residues, Aqp14 proteins 
      present five non-aromatic constriction residues and facilitate the permeation of 
      water, urea, ammonia, H(2)O(2) and glycerol. Immunocytochemical assays suggest that 
      Aqp14 channels play important osmoregulatory roles in piscine seawater adaptation. 
      Our data indicate that Aqp14 intracellular trafficking is tightly regulated by the 
      vasotocinergic/isotocinergic neuropeptide and receptor systems, whereby protein 
      kinase C and A transduction pathways phosphorylate highly conserved C-terminal 
      residues to control channel plasma membrane insertion. The neuropeptide regulation 
      of Aqp14 channels thus predates the vasotocin/vasopressin regulation of AQP2-5-6 
      orthologs observed in tetrapods. These findings demonstrate that vertebrate Aqp14 
      channels represent an ancient subfamily of neuropeptide-regulated polytransporters.

TI  - Genome size, secondary simplification, and the evolution of the brain in 
      salamanders.
PG  - 50-9
AB  - Compared to other vertebrates, even including lampreys and hagfishes in some 
      respects, salamanders exhibit a relatively simple organization of brain and sense 
      organs which is illustrated here using the visual system as an example. The greatest 
      simplicity is found in the bolitoglossine salamanders, yet all bolitoglossines 
      possess highly projectile tongues and rely on vision for survival; furthermore, some 
      species are agile and acrobatic. The unusual features of the visual system of 
      salamanders include small numbers of large neurons, a low degree of morphological 
      differentiation among neurons, a small proportion of myelinated axons in the optic 
      nerve, and an optic tectum consisting essentially of a periventricular cellular 
      layer and a superficial fiber layer. Similar features are found throughout the 
      central nervous system of salamanders and in the lateral line, auditory and 
      olfactory systems as well. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the most parsimonious 
      interpretation of these data is that the simple organization of the brain and sense 
      organs of salamanders was derived secondarily from a more complex ancestral state. 
      We hypothesize that increased genome size has led to simplification of the nervous 
      system in salamanders. Increased genome size appears to have had profound effects on 
      neural development in salamanders, leading to paedomorphosis, the retention of 
      juvenile or even embryonic characteristics into adulthood. In particular, large 
      genome size is associated with large cell size and reduced rates of cell 
      proliferation, migration and differentiation. Secondary simplification has 
      constrained the function of the salamanders' visual system, primarily by increasing 
      cell size and decreasing cell numbers. However, it also has provided an opportunity 
      for the evolution of compensating mechanisms, which have helped to restore or even 
      enhance visual function. Most apparent among the compensatory mechanisms of 
      bolitoglossine salamanders is the presence of well developed ipsilateral 
      retinotectal projections, which apparently enhance depth perception. It is difficult 
      to explain the unusual history of the nervous system in salamanders solely in terms 
      of natural selection and adaptation. Increasing genome size through selfish 
      replication appears to have played a major role in the evolution of salamander 
      brains by imposing functional constraints as well as creating opportunities for 
      overcoming them.

      provide insights into the evolution of the vertebrate heart and thereby increase our 
      understanding of cardiac function in higher vertebrates, including mammals. To this 
      end, electrical excitability of the heart in a basal vertebrate, the European river 
      lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis), was examined. Ion currents of cardiac myocytes, 
      action potentials (APs) of atrial and ventricular muscle, and electrocardiogram (in 
      vivo) were measured using the patch-clamp method, intracellular microelectrodes, and 
      trailing wires, respectively. The characteristic features of fairly high heart rate 
      (28.4 ± 3 beats min(-1)) and short AP duration (550 ± 44 and 122.1 ± 28.5 for 
      ventricle and atrium, respectively) at low ambient temperature (5°C) are shared with 
      cold-active teleost fishes. However, the ion current basis of the ventricular AP 
      differs from that of other fishes. For inward currents, sodium current density (INa) 
      is lower and calcium current density (ICa) higher than in teleost ventricles, while 
      the kinetics of INa is slow and that of ICa is fast in comparison. Among the 
      ventricular repolarizing currents, the delayed rectifier K(+) current is smaller 
      than in myocytes of several teleost species. Unlike mammalian hearts, ATP-sensitive 
      K(+) channels are constitutively open under normoxic conditions, thus contributing 
      to negative resting membrane potential and repolarization of APs. Upstroke velocity 
      of AP (5.4 ± 0.9 and 6.3 ± 0.6 V s(-1) for ventricular and atrial myocytes, 
      respectively) is slower than in teleost hearts. Excitability of the lamprey heart 
      seems to possess both primitive and advanced characteristics. Short APs are 
      appropriate to support brief and vigorous contractions (in common with higher 
      vertebrates), while relatively low AP upstroke velocities enable only relatively 
      slow propagation of contraction over the heart.

TI  - Evolution of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) action: in vitro characterization 
      of vertebrate IGF-I proteins.
PG  - 35-41
AB  - While there is considerable structural evidence that IGFs share a long evolutionary 
      history, less is known about the conservation of IGF action. These studies have 
      primarily been hampered by the small amounts of purified IGFs that have been 
      available for testing. More recently, however, we have adopted recombinant 
      strategies to produce milligram quantities of IGFs for biological studies. Thus we 
      have been able to compare the properties of rat, kangaroo, chicken, salmon and 
      barramundi IGF-I, proteins that differ from human IGF-I by 3, 6, 8, 14 and 16 amino 
      acids respectively. While we have found that the IGF-I proteins exhibit similar 
      biological activities and type-I IGF receptor binding affinities, regardless of 
      whether mammalian, avian or piscine cell lines are used, there was a trend 
      suggesting that the fish proteins at least, were most effective in studies using 
      homologous systems. Thus, salmon IGF-I was not as potent as human IGF-I in bioassays 
      in mammalian cells, but was as effective as human IGF-I in piscine cells. As 
      expected, the IGF-I proteins competed poorly for binding to type-2 receptors present 
      on ovine placental membranes. Interestingly however, the two fish IGF-I proteins 
      exhibited greater affinity for this receptor than the other IGF-I proteins, hence 
      reminiscent of the results previously found with recombinant hagfish IGF. Despite 
      these small differences, these results taken together indicate that the IGF-I 
      proteins appear to have been remarkably conserved in both structure and in vitro 
      action during vertebrate radiation.

TI  - Identification and characterization of insulin receptors on foetal-mouse 
      brain-cortical cells.
PG  - 165-72
AB  - The occurrence of insulin receptors was investigated in freshly dissociated 
      brain-cortical cells from mouse embryos. By analogy with classical insulin-binding 
      cell types, binding of 125I-insulin to foetal brain-cortical cells was time- and 
      pH-dependent, only partially reversible, and competed for by unlabelled insulin and 
      closely related peptides. Desalanine-desasparagine-insulin, pig proinsulin, hagfish 
      insulin and turkey insulin were respectively 2%, 4%, 2% and 200% as potent as bovine 
      insulin in inhibiting 125I-insulin binding to brain-cortical cells, which 
      corresponds to their relative biological potencies in classical insulin-target 
      cells; no competition was observed with glucagon and nerve growth factor, even at 
      high concentrations. Scatchard analysis of competitive-binding data resulted in 
      curvilinear plots with a high-affinity binding of Ka = 3.6 X 10(8) M-1. Insulin 
      binding to foetal brain-cortical cells differed, however, in two distinct aspects 
      from that to classical insulin-binding cell types. Firstly, dilution of 
      125I-insulin-bound cells in the presence of unlabelled insulin did not accelerate 
      dissociation of the labelled hormone. Secondly, exposure of brain-cortical cells to 
      insulin before the binding assay enhanced insulin binding, suggesting up-regulation 
      of insulin receptors in response to insulin. In conclusion, foetal-mouse 
      brain-cortical cells bear specific binding sites for insulin. Their insulin receptor 
      shows a marked specificity and affinity for insulin, but differs in at least two 
      properties from most classical insulin receptors. These differences in 
      hormone-receptor interaction could reflect structural differences between insulin 
      receptors on embryonic and differentiated cells.

TI  - 30 YEARS OF THE MINERALOCORTICOID RECEPTOR: Evolution of the mineralocorticoid 
      receptor: sequence, structure and function.
PG  - T1-T16
LID - 10.1530/JOE-16-0661 [doi]
AB  - The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is descended from a corticoid receptor (CR), 
      which has descendants in lamprey and hagfish, cyclostomes (jawless fish), a taxon 
      that evolved at the base of the vertebrate line. A distinct MR and GR first appear 
      in cartilaginous fishes (Chondrichthyes), such as sharks, skates, rays and chimeras. 
      Skate MR has a strong response to corticosteroids that are mineralocorticoids and 
      glucocorticoids in humans. The half-maximal responses (EC50s) for skate MR for the 
      mineralocorticoids aldosterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone are 0.07 nM and 0.03 nM, 
      respectively. EC50s for the glucocorticoids cortisol and corticosterone are 1 nM and 
      0.09 nM, respectively. The physiological mineralocorticoid in ray-finned fish, which 
      do not synthesize aldosterone, is not fully understood because several 
      3-ketosteroids, including cortisol, 11-deoxycortisol, corticosterone, 
      11-deoxycorticosterone and progesterone are transcriptional activators of fish MR. 
      Further divergence of the MR and GR in terrestrial vertebrates, which synthesize 
      aldosterone, led to emergence of aldosterone as a selective ligand for the MR. Here, 
      we combine sequence analysis of the CR and vertebrate MRs and GRs, analysis of 
      crystal structures of human MR and GR and data on transcriptional activation by 
      3-ketosteroids of wild-type and mutant MRs and GRs to investigate the evolution of 
      selectivity for 3-ketosteroids by the MR in terrestrial vertebrates and ray-finned 
      fish, as well as the basis for binding of some glucocorticoids by human MR and other 
      vertebrate MRs.

TI  - Role of RNA splicing in mediating lineage-specific expression of the von Willebrand 
      factor gene in the endothelium.
PG  - 4404-12
LID - 10.1182/blood-2012-12-473785 [doi]
AB  - We previously demonstrated that the first intron of the human von Willebrand factor 
      (vWF) is required for gene expression in the endothelium of transgenic mice. Based 
      on this finding, we hypothesized that RNA splicing plays a role in mediating vWF 
      expression in the vasculature. To address this question, we used transient 
      transfection assays in human endothelial cells and megakaryocytes with 
      intron-containing and intronless human vWF promoter-luciferase constructs. Next, we 
      generated knockin mice in which LacZ was targeted to the endogenous mouse vWF locus 
      in the absence or presence of the native first intron or heterologous introns from 
      the human β-globin, mouse Down syndrome critical region 1, or hagfish coagulation 
      factor X genes. In both the in vitro assays and the knockin mice, the loss of the 
      first intron of vWF resulted in a significant reduction of reporter gene expression 
      in endothelial cells but not megakaryocytes. This effect was rescued to varying 
      degrees by the introduction of a heterologous intron. Intron-mediated enhancement of 
      expression was mediated at a posttranscriptional level. Together, these findings 
      implicate a role for intronic splicing in mediating lineage-specific expression of 
      vWF in the endothelium.

TI  - Characterization of zebrafish full-length prothrombin cDNA and linkage group 
      mapping.
PG  - 479-89
AB  - In this paper, we report the complete cDNA sequence of zebrafish prothrombin. The 
      cDNA sequence predicts that zebrafish prothrombin is synthesized as a pre-proprotein 
      consisting of a Gla domain, two kringle domains, and a two-chain protease domain. 
      Zebrafish prothrombin is structurally very similar to human and other vertebrate 
      prothrombins. Zebrafish and human prothrombin share 53% amino acid identity whereas 
      zebrafish and hagfish prothrombin share 51% identity. Amino acid alignments of 
      various prothrombins identified conservation of many of the functional/structural 
      motifs suggesting that the vertebrate prothrombins may have similar functions. The 
      three-dimensional structure of prothrombin predicted by homology modeling also 
      revealed that the prothrombin fragment 1 and the catalytic domain structures are 
      well conserved except for the insertion of an extra 7-amino-acid loop in the 
      connecting region (CR) between the Gla and kringle I domain of fragment 1. Linkage 
      analysis revealed that the prothrombin gene locus on linkage group 7 in zebrafish is 
      syntenic to the human chromosome 11-prothrombin region suggesting its preservation 
      through evolution. The availability of this cDNA sequence in zebrafish adds to our 
      knowledge of the zebrafish hemostatic system and provides support for the view that 
      similarities between zebrafish and mammalian coagulation exist, thus underscoring 
      the relevance of the zebrafish model for studying human hemostasis.

      particularly understudied. Novel Internet Operated Vehicles (IOVs), such as tracked 
      crawlers, provide new techniques for investigating these ecosystems over prolonged 
      periods. In this study a benthic crawler connected to the NEPTUNE cabled 
      infrastructure operated by Ocean Networks Canada was used to monitor community 
      changes across 60 m2 of a cold-seep area of the Barkley Canyon, North East Pacific, 
      at ~890 m depth within an Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ). Short video-transects were run 
      at 4-h intervals during the first week of successive calendar months, over a 14 
      month period (February 14th 2013 to April 14th 2014). Within each recorded transect 
      video megafauna abundances were computed and changes in environmental conditions 
      concurrently measured. The responses of fauna to environmental conditions as a proxy 
      of seasonality were assessed through analysis of abundances in a total of 438 
      video-transects (over 92 h of total footage). 7698 fauna individuals from 6 phyla 
      (Cnidaria, Ctenophora, Arthropoda, Echinodermata, Mollusca, and Chordata) were 
      logged and patterns in abundances of the 7 most abundant taxa (i.e. rockfish 
      Sebastidae, sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria, hagfish Eptatretus stoutii, buccinids 
      (Buccinoidea), undefined small crabs, ctenophores Bolinopsis infundibulum, and 
      Scyphomedusa Poralia rufescens) were identified. Patterns in the reproductive 
      behaviour of the grooved tanner crab (Chionnecetes tanneri) were also indicated. 
      Temporal variations in biodiversity and abundance in megabenthic fauna was 
      significantly influenced by variabilities in flow velocity flow direction (up or 
      down canyon), dissolved oxygen concentration and month of study. Also reported here 
      for the first time are transient mass aggregations of grooved tanner crabs through 
      these depths of the canyon system, in early spring and likely linked to the crab's 
      reproductive cycle.

AB  - Jellyfish blooms are common in many oceans, and anthropogenic changes appear to have 
      increased their magnitude in some regions. Although mass falls of jellyfish 
      carcasses have been observed recently at the deep seafloor, the dense necrophage 
      aggregations and rapid consumption rates typical for vertebrate carrion have not 
      been documented. This has led to a paradigm of limited energy transfer to higher 
      trophic levels at jelly falls relative to vertebrate organic falls. We show from 
      baited camera deployments in the Norwegian deep sea that dense aggregations of 
      deep-sea scavengers (more than 1000 animals at peak densities) can rapidly form at 
      jellyfish baits and consume entire jellyfish carcasses in 2.5 h. We also show that 
      scavenging rates on jellyfish are not significantly different from fish carrion of 
      similar mass, and reveal that scavenging communities typical for the NE Atlantic 
      bathyal zone, including the Atlantic hagfish, galatheid crabs, decapod shrimp and 
      lyssianasid amphipods, consume both types of carcasses. These rapid jellyfish 
      carrion consumption rates suggest that the contribution of gelatinous material to 
      organic fluxes may be seriously underestimated in some regions, because jelly falls 
      may disappear much more rapidly than previously thought. Our results also 
      demonstrate that the energy contained in gelatinous carrion can be efficiently 
      incorporated into large numbers of deep-sea scavengers and food webs, lessening the 
      expected impacts (e.g. smothering of the seafloor) of enhanced jellyfish production 
      on deep-sea ecosystems and pelagic-benthic coupling.

TI  - Functional noncoding sequences derived from SINEs in the mammalian genome.
PG  - 864-74
AB  - Recent comparative analyses of mammalian sequences have revealed that a large number 
      of nonprotein-coding genomic regions are under strong selective constraint. Here, we 
      report that some of these loci have been derived from a newly defined family of 
      ancient SINEs (short interspersed repetitive elements). This is a surprising result, 
      as SINEs and other transposable elements are commonly thought to be genomic 
      parasites. We named the ancient SINE family AmnSINE1, for Amniota SINE1, because we 
      found it to be present in mammals as well as in birds, and some copies predate the 
      mammalian-bird split 310 million years ago (Mya). AmnSINE1 has a chimeric structure 
      of a 5S rRNA and a tRNA-derived SINE, and is related to five tRNA-derived SINE 
      families that we characterized here in the coelacanth, dogfish shark, hagfish, and 
      amphioxus genomes. All of the newly described SINE families have a common central 
      domain that is also shared by zebrafish SINE3, and we collectively name them the 
      DeuSINE (Deuterostomia SINE) superfamily. Notably, of the approximately 1000 still 
      identifiable copies of AmnSINE1 in the human genome, 105 correspond to loci 
      phylogenetically highly conserved among mammalian orthologs. The conservation is 
      strongest over the central domain. Thus, AmnSINE1 appears to be the best example of 
      a transposable element of which a significant fraction of the copies have acquired 
      genomic functionality.

TI  - Dendritic distribution of two populations of ganglion cells and the retinopetal 
      fibers in the retina of the silver lamprey (Ichthyomyzon unicuspis).
PG  - 533-45
AB  - The distribution of ganglion cells in the retina of the silver lamprey, Ichthyomyzon 
      unicuspis, was revealed by retrograde labeling from the optic nerve with horseradish 
      peroxidase (HRP) and fluorescent-labeled dextrans in live animals and with the 
      fluorescent dye DiI in aldehyde-fixed tissue. The majority of ganglion cells (74%) 
      termed the "outer ganglion cells," are multipolar and are located at the vitread 
      boundary of the inner nuclear layer. The remaining ganglion cells (26%), termed the 
      "inner ganglion cells" are bipolar and are distributed in a sublamina within the 
      inner plexiform layer. The dense, dendritic meshwork of the outer ganglion cells is 
      largely restricted to the sclerad half of the inner plexiform layer with some cells 
      possessing dendrites which pass through the inner nuclear layer to terminate within 
      the outer plexiform layer. The dendrites of the inner ganglion cells form a thin, 
      dendritic network apposing the inner limiting membrane. Axons from both populations 
      of ganglion cells originate from dendrites or the soma and form fascicles lying 
      adjacent to the outer ganglion cell somata. Retinopetal fibers, originating from 
      bilaterally distributed neurons of the tegmental midbrain, were thin and varicose 
      and ran parallel to the ganglion cell axons to terminate either with a varicose 
      enlargement or a few short sidebranches in the sclerad third of the inner plexiform 
      layer. The unusual organization of the lamprey retina and outgroup comparison with 
      hagfish suggests that agnathans share a presumably primitive type of retinal 
      ganglion cell organization compared to that of gnathostomes.

      misery-fleeing behavioral mechanisms in vertebrates.

LID - 10.3389/fnins.2015.00394 [doi]

AB  - The very first free-moving animals in the oceans over 540 million years ago must 
      have been able to obtain food, territory, and shelter, as well as reproduce. 
      Therefore, they would have needed regulatory mechanisms to induce movements enabling 
      achievement of these prerequisites for survival. It can be useful to consider these 
      mechanisms in primitive chordates, which represent our earliest ancestors, to 
      develop hypotheses addressing how these essential parts of human behavior are 
      regulated and relate to more sophisticated behavioral manifestations such as mood. 
      An animal comparable to lampreys was the earliest known vertebrate with a modern 
      forebrain consisting of old and new cortical parts. Lampreys have a separate dorsal 
      pallium, the forerunner of the most recently developed part of the cerebral cortex. 
      In addition, the lamprey extrapyramidal system (EPS), which regulates movement, is 
      modern. However, in lampreys and their putative forerunners, the hagfishes, the 
      striatum, which is the input part of this EPS, probably corresponds to the human 
      centromedial amygdala, which in higher vertebrates is part of a system mediating 
      fear and anxiety. Both animals have well-developed nuclear habenulae, which are 
      involved in several critical behaviors; in lampreys this system regulates the reward 
      system that reinforces appetitive-seeking behavior or the avoidance system that 
      reinforces flight behavior resulting from negative inputs. Lampreys also have a 
      distinct glutamatergic nucleus, the so-called habenula-projection globus pallidus, 
      which receives input from glutamatergic and GABAergic signals and gives output to 
      the lateral habenula. Via this route, this nucleus influences midbrain monoaminergic 
      nuclei and regulates the food acquisition system. These various structures involved 
      in motor regulation in the lampreys may be conserved in humans and include two 
      complementary mechanisms for reward reinforcement and avoidance behaviors. The first 
      system is associated with experiencing pleasure and the second with happiness. The 
      activities of these mechanisms are regulated by a tract running via the habenula to 
      the upper brainstem. Identifying the human correlate of the lamprey 
      habenula-projecting globus pallidus may help in elucidating the mechanism of the 
      antidepressant effects of glutamatergic drugs.

TI  - Generation of Lamprey Monoclonal Antibodies (Lampribodies) Using the Phage Display 
      System.
LID - 10.3390/biom9120868 [doi]
LID - 868
AB  - The variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) consist of leucine rich repeats (LRRs) and 
      comprise the humoral antibodies produced by lampreys and hagfishes. The diversity of 
      the molecules is generated by stepwise genomic rearrangements of LRR cassettes 
      dispersed throughout the VLRB locus. Previously, target-specific monovalent VLRB 
      antibodies were isolated from sea lamprey larvae after immunization with model 
      antigens. Further, the cloned VLR cDNAs from activated lamprey leukocytes were 
      transfected into human cell lines or yeast to select best binders. Here, we expand 
      on the overall utility of the VLRB technology by introducing it into a filamentous 
      phage display system. We first tested the efficacy of isolating phage into which 
      known VLRB molecules were cloned after a series of dilutions. These experiments 
      showed that targeted VLRB clones could easily be recovered even after extensive 
      dilutions (1 to 10(9)). We further utilized the system to isolate target-specific 
      "lampribodies" from phage display libraries from immunized animals and observed an 
      amplification of binders with relative high affinities by competitive binding. The 
      lampribodies can be individually purified and ostensibly utilized for applications 
      for which conventional monoclonal antibodies are employed.

      Actinistia], and comparisons with other craniata.
PG  - 1-76
AB  - We reconstructed the cranial nerves of a serially sectioned prenatal coelacanth, 
      Latimeria chalumnae. This allowed us to correct several mistakes in the literature 
      and to make broad phylogenetic comparisons with other craniates. The genera surveyed 
      in our phylogenetic analysis were Eptatretus, Myxine, Petromyzon, Lampetra, 
      Chimaera, Hydrolagus, Squalus, Mustelus, Polypterus, Acipenser, Lepisosteus, Amia, 
      Neoceratodus, Protopterus, Lepidosiren, Latimeria and Ambystoma. Cladistic analysis 
      of our data shows that Latimeria shares with Ambystoma two characters of the cranial 
      nerves. Our chief findings are: 1) Latimeria possesses an external nasal papilla and 
      pedunculated olfactory bulbs but lacks a discrete terminal nerve. In other respects 
      its olfactory system resembles the plesiomorphic pattern for craniates. 2) The optic 
      nerve is plicated, a character found in many but not all gnathostomes. Latimeria 
      retains an interdigitated partial decussation of the optic nerves, a character found 
      in all craniates surveyed. 3) The oculomotor nerve supplies the same extrinsic eye 
      muscles as in lampreys and gnathostomes. As in gnathostomes generally, Latimeria has 
      a ciliary ganglion but its cells are located intracranially in the root of the 
      oculomotor nerve, and their processes reach the eye via oculomotor and profundal 
      rami. 4) The trochlear nerve supplies the superior oblique muscle as in all 
      craniates that have not secondarily reduced the eye and its extrinsic musculature. 
      5) The profundal ganglion and ramus are entirely separate from the trigeminal 
      system, with no exchange of fibers. This character has an interesting phylogenetic 
      distribution: in hagfishes, lampreys, lungfishes and tetrapods, the profundal and 
      trigeminal ganglia are fused, whereas in other taxa surveyed the ganglia are 
      separate. The principal tissues innervated by the profundal nerve are the membranous 
      walls of the tubes of the rostral organ. 6) As in lampreys and gnathostomes, the 
      trigeminal nerve has maxillary and mandibular rami. Unlike all other gnathostomes 
      surveyed, the trigeminal nerve of Latimeria lacks a sizable superficial ophthalmic 
      ramus. Thus, Latimeria lacks the well-developed superficial ophthalmic complex 
      reported in most other fishes. As in gnathostomes generally, the maxillary ramus of 
      the trigeminal nerve fuses with the buccal ramus of the anterodorsal lateral line 
      nerve to form the buccal+maxillary complex. We reject the term 'Gasserian ganglion', 
      which is often applied to the fused profundal and trigeminal ganglion of tetrapods. 
      7) The abducent nerve innervates not only the lateral rectus muscle (a character 
      common to myopterygians) but also the basicranial muscle. As we previously reported, 
      it is probable that the basicranial muscle of Latimeria is homologous to the ocular 
      retracter muscle of amphibians.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - 11-Deoxycortisol controls hydromineral balance in the most basal osmoregulating 
      vertebrate, sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus).

AB  - It is unknown whether and how osmoregulation is controlled by corticosteroid 
      signaling in the phylogenetically basal vertebrate group Agnatha, including lampreys 
      and hagfishes. It is known that a truncated steroid biosynthetic pathway in lampreys 
      produces two predominant circulating corticosteroids, 11-deoxycortisol (S) and 
      11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC). Furthermore, lampreys express only a single, ancestral 
      corticosteroid receptor (CR). Whether S and/or DOC interact with the CR to control 
      osmoregulation in lampreys is still unknown. We examined the role of the endogenous 
      corticosteroids in vivo and ex vivo in sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) during the 
      critical metamorphic period during which sea lamprey increase osmoregulatory 
      capacity and acquire seawater (SW) tolerance. We demonstrate in vivo that increases 
      in circulating [S] and gill CR abundance are associated with increases in 
      osmoregulatory capacity during metamorphosis. We further show that in vivo and ex 
      vivo treatment with S increases activity and expression of gill active ion 
      transporters and improves SW tolerance, and that only S (and not DOC) has regulatory 
      control over active ion transport in the gills. Lastly, we show that the lamprey CR 
      expresses an ancestral, spironolactone-as-agonist structural motif and that 
      spironolactone treatment in vivo increases osmoregulatory capacity. Together, these 
      results demonstrate that S is an osmoregulatory hormone in lamprey and that 
      receptor-mediated discriminative corticosteroid regulation of hydromineral balance 
      is an evolutionarily basal trait among vertebrates.

TI  - Retinal temporal resolution and contrast sensitivity in the parasitic lamprey 
      Mordacia mordax and its non-parasitic derivative Mordacia praecox.

AB  - Lampreys and hagfishes are the sole extant representatives of the early agnathan 
      (jawless) vertebrates. We compared retinal function of fully metamorphosed, immature 
      Mordacia mordax (which are about to commence parasitic feeding) with those of 
      sexually mature individuals of its non-parasitic derivative Mpraecox We focused on 
      elucidating the retinal adaptations to dim-light environments in these nocturnally 
      active lampreys, using electroretinography to determine the temporal resolution 
      (flicker fusion frequency, FFF) and temporal contrast sensitivity of enucleated 
      eyecups at different temperatures and light intensities. FFF was significantly 
      affected by temperature and light intensity. Critical flicker fusion frequency 
      (cFFF, the highest FFF recorded) of M. praecox and M. mordax increased from 15.1 and 
      21.8 Hz at 9°C to 31.1 and 36.9 Hz at 24°C, respectively. Contrast sensitivity of 
      both species increased by an order of magnitude between 9 and 24°C, but remained 
      comparatively constant across all light intensities. Although FFF values for 
      Mordacia spp. are relatively low, retinal responses showed a particularly high 
      contrast sensitivity of 625 in M. praecox and 710 in M. mordax at 24°C. This 
      suggests selective pressures favour low temporal resolution and high contrast 
      sensitivity in both species, thereby enhancing the capture of photons and increasing 
      sensitivity in their light-limited environments. FFF indicated all retinal 
      photoreceptors exhibit the same temporal response. Although the slow response 
      kinetics (i.e. low FFF) and saturation of the response at bright light intensities 
      characterise the photoreceptors of both species as rod-like, it is unusual for such 
      a photoreceptor to be functional under scotopic and photopic conditions.

TI  - Morphology and spectral absorption characteristics of retinal photoreceptors in the 
      southern hemisphere lamprey (Geotria australis).
PG  - 119-30
AB  - The morphology and spectral absorption characteristics of the retinal photoreceptors 
      in the southern hemisphere lamprey Geotria australis (Agnatha) were studied using 
      light and electron microscopy and microspectrophotometry. The retinae of both 
      downstream and upstream migrants of Geotria contained two types of cone 
      photoreceptor and one type of rod photoreceptor. Visual pigments contained in the 
      outer segments of these three photoreceptor types had absorbance spectra typical of 
      porphyropsins and with wavelengths of maximum absorbance (downstream/upstream) at 
      610/616 nm (long-wavelength-sensitive cone, LWS), 515/515 nm 
      (medium-wavelength-sensitive cone, MWS), and 506/500 nm (medium-wavelength-sensitive 
      rod). A "yellow" photostable pigment was present in the myoid region of all three 
      types of photoreceptor in the downstream migrant. The same 
      short-wavelength-absorbing pigment, which prevents photostimulation of the beta band 
      of the visual pigment in the outer segment, was present in the rods and LWS cones of 
      the upstream migrant, but was replaced by a large transparent ellipsosome in the MWS 
      cones. Using microspectrophotometric and anatomical data, the quantal spectral 
      sensitivity of each photoreceptor type was calculated. Our results provide the first 
      evidence of a jawless vertebrate, represented today solely by the lampreys and 
      hagfishes, with two morphologically and physiologically distinct types of cone 
      photoreceptors, in addition to a rod-like photoreceptor containing a colored filter 
      (a cone-like characteristic). In contrast, all other lampreys studied thus far have 
      either (1) one type of cone and one type of rod, or (2) a single type of rod-like 
      photoreceptor. The evolution or retention of a second type of cone in adult Geotria 
      is presumably an adaptation to life in the brightly lit surface waters of the 
      Southern Ocean, where this species lives during the marine phase of its life cycle. 
      The functional significance of the unique visual system of Geotria is discussed in 
      relation to its life cycle and the potential for color vision.

TI  - Action of antimicrobial peptides and their prodrugs on model and biological 
      membranes.
PG  - e3086
LID - 10.1002/psc.3086 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising broad-spectrum antibiotic candidates in 
      the wake of multi-drug resistant pathogens. Their clinical use still requires a 
      solution based on lead optimisation and/or formulation to overcome certain 
      limitations, such as unwanted cytotoxicity. A prodrug approach could overcome this 
      safety barrier and can be achieved through reversible reduction or neutralisation of 
      the AMPs' net cationic charge. By prodrug activation through pathogen associated 
      enzymes, this approach could increase the therapeutic index of membrane active 
      peptides. P18, a cecropin/magainin hybrid, and WMR, a myxinidin analogue from 
      hagfish, were used as templates for the design strategy. The membrane permeabilizing 
      activities of these AMPs and their prodrugs are reported here for liposomes of 
      either Escherichia coli polar lipid extract or a human model lipid system of 
      phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol. These results are compared with their 
      antibacterial and haemolytic activities. Overall, correlation between liposome 
      permeabilization and the corresponding bioactivity is observed and indicate that the 
      broad-spectrum antibacterial effect exerted by these peptides is associated with 
      membrane disruption. Furthermore, the prodrug modification had a general negative 
      influence on membrane disruption and bioactivity, notably as much on bacterial as on 
      human membranes. This prodrug strategy is particularly successful when complete 
      neutralisation of the AMP's net charge occurs. Thus, on-target selectivity between 
      bacterial and human membranes can be improved, which may be used to prevent the 
      unnecessary exposure of host cells and commensal bacteria to active AMPs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The microtubule associated protein Tau (MAPT) promotes assembly and 
      interaction of microtubules with the cytoskeleton, impinging on axonal transport and 
      synaptic plasticity. Its neuronal expression and intrinsic disorder implicate it in 
      some 30 tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. These 
      pathophysiological studies have yet to be complemented by computational analyses of 
      its molecular evolution and structural models of all its functional domains to 
      explain the molecular basis for its conservation profile, its site-specific 
      interactions and the propensity to conformational disorder and aggregate formation. 
      RESULTS: We systematically annotated public sequence data to reconstruct unspliced 
      MAPT, MAP2 and MAP4 transcripts spanning all represented genomes. Bayesian and 
      maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses, genetic linkage maps and domain 
      architectures distinguished a nonvertebrate outgroup from the emergence of MAP4 and 
      its subsequent ancestral duplication to MAP2 and MAPT. These events were coupled to 
      other linked genes such as KANSL1L and KANSL and may thus be consequent to 
      large-scale chromosomal duplications originating in the extant vertebrate genomes of 
      hagfish and lamprey. Profile hidden Markov models (pHMMs), clustered subalignments 
      and 3D structural predictions defined potential interaction motifs and specificity 
      determining sites to reveal distinct signatures between the four homologous 
      microtubule binding domains and independent divergence of the amino terminus. 
      CONCLUSION: These analyses clarified ambiguities of MAPT nomenclature, defined the 
      order, timing and pattern of its molecular evolution and identified key residues and 
      motifs relevant to its protein interaction properties and pathogenic role. 
      Additional unexpected findings included the expansion of cysteine-containing, 
      microtubule binding domains of MAPT in cold adapted Antarctic icefish and the 
      emergence of a novel multiexonic saitohin (STH) gene from repetitive elements in 
      MAPT intron 11 of certain primate genomes.

AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane glycolipid, 
      induces sepsis through its interaction with myeloid differentiation protein-2 (MD-2) 
      and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). To block interaction between LPS/MD-2 complex and 
      TLR4, we designed and generated soluble fusion proteins capable of binding MD-2, 
      dubbed TLR4 decoy receptor (TOY) using 'the Hybrid leucine-rich repeats (LRR) 
      technique'. TOY contains the MD-2 binding ectodomain of TLR4, the LRR motif of 
      hagfish variable lymphocyte receptor (VLR), and the Fc domain of IgG1 to make it 
      soluble, productive, and functional. TOY exhibited strong binding to MD-2, but not 
      to the extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in a favorable pharmacokinetic profile 
      in vivo. TOY significantly extended the lifespan, when administered in either 
      preventive or therapeutic manners, in both the LPS- and cecal 
      ligation/puncture-induced sepsis models in mice. TOY markedly attenuated 
      LPS-triggered NF-kappaB activation, secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, and 
      thrombus formation in multiple organs. Taken together, the targeting strategy for 
      sequestration of LPS/MD-2 complex using the decoy receptor TOY is effective in 
      treating LPS- and bacteria-induced sepsis; furthermore, the strategy used in TOY 
      development can be applied to the generation of other novel decoy receptor proteins.

TI  - Antimicrobial peptides at work: interaction of myxinidin and its mutant WMR with 
      lipid bilayers mimicking the P. aeruginosa and E. coli membranes.
PG  - 44425

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are promising candidates as future therapeutics in order to 
      face the problem of antibiotic resistance caused by pathogenic bacteria. Myxinidin 
      is a peptide derived from the hagfish mucus displaying activity against a broad 
      range of bacteria. We have focused our studies on the physico-chemical 
      characterization of the interaction of myxinidin and its mutant WMR, which contains 
      a tryptophan residue at the N-terminus and four additional positive charges, with 
      two model biological membranes (DOPE/DOPG 80/20 and DOPE/DOPG/CL 65/23/12), 
      mimicking respectively Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa membrane 
      bilayers. All our results have coherently shown that, although both myxinidin and 
      WMR interact with the two membranes, their effect on membrane microstructure and 
      stability are different. We further have shown that the presence of cardiolipin 
      plays a key role in the WMR-membrane interaction. Particularly, WMR drastically 
      perturbs the DOPE/DOPG/CL membrane stability inducing a segregation of anionic 
      lipids. On the contrary, myxinidin is not able to significantly perturb the 
      DOPE/DOPG/CL bilayer whereas interacts better with the DOPE/DOPG bilayer causing a 
      significant perturbing effect of the lipid acyl chains. These findings are fully 
      consistent with the reported greater antimicrobial activity of WMR against P. 
      aeruginosa compared with myxinidin.

TI  - Vipericidins: a novel family of cathelicidin-related peptides from the venom gland 
      of South American pit vipers.
PG  - 2561-71
LID - 10.1007/s00726-014-1801-4 [doi]
AB  - Cathelicidins are phylogenetically ancient, pleiotropic host defense peptides-also 
      called antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)-expressed in numerous life forms for innate 
      immunity. Since even the jawless hagfish expresses cathelicidins, these genetically 
      encoded host defense peptides are at least 400 million years old. More recently, 
      cathelicidins with varying antipathogenic activities and cytotoxicities were 
      discovered in the venoms of poisonous snakes; for these creatures, cathelicidins may 
      also serve as weapons against prey and predators, as well as for innate immunity. We 
      report herein the expression of orthologous cathelicidin genes in the venoms of four 
      different South American pit vipers (Bothrops atrox, Bothrops lutzi, Crotalus 
      durissus terrificus, and Lachesis muta rhombeata)-distant relatives of Asian cobras 
      and kraits, previously shown to express cathelicidins-and an elapid, Pseudonaja 
      textilis. We identified six novel, genetically encoded peptides: four from pit 
      vipers, collectively named vipericidins, and two from the elapid. These new 
      venom-derived cathelicidins exhibited potent killing activity against a number of 
      bacterial strains (S. pyogenes, A. baumannii, E. faecalis, S. aureus, E. coli, K. 
      pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa), mostly with relatively less potent hemolysis, 
      indicating their possible usefulness as lead structures for the development of new 
      anti-infective agents. It is worth noting that these South American snake venom 
      peptides are comparable in cytotoxicity (e.g., hemolysis) to human cathelicidin 
      LL-37, and much lower than other membrane-active peptides such as mastoparan 7 and 
      melittin from bee venom. Overall, the excellent bactericidal profile of vipericidins 
      suggests they are a promising template for the development of broad-spectrum peptide 
      antibiotics.

TI  - Oversulfated dermatan sulfate exhibits neurite outgrowth-promoting activity toward 
      embryonic mouse hippocampal neurons: implications of dermatan sulfate in 
      neuritogenesis in the brain.
PG  - 43744-54
AB  - Brain-specific chondroitin sulfate (CS) proteoglycan (PG) DSD-1-PG/6B4-PG/phosphacan 
      isolated from neonatal mouse brains exhibits neurite outgrowth-promoting activity 
      toward embryonic rat and mouse hippocampal neurons in vitro through the so-called 
      DSD-1 epitope embedded in its glycosaminoglycan side chains. Oversulfated CS 
      variants, CS-D from shark cartilage and CS-E from squid cartilage, also possess 
      similar activities. We have proposed that the neuritogenic property of the DSD-1 
      epitope may be attributable to a distinct CS structure characterized by the 
      disulfated D disaccharide unit [GlcUA(2S)-GalNAc(6S)]. In this study, we assessed 
      neuritogenic potencies of various oversulfated dermatan sulfate (DS) preparations 
      purified from hagfish notochord, the bodies of two kinds of ascidians and embryonic 
      sea urchin, which are characterized by the predominant disulfated disaccharide units 
      of [IdoUA-GalNAc(4S,6S)] (68%), [IdoUA(2S)-GalNAc(4S)] (66%) plus 
      [IdoUA(2S)-GalNAc(6S)] (5%), [IdoUA(2S)-GalNAc (6S)] (>90%), and 
      [IdoUA-GalNAc(4S,6S)] (74%), respectively. They exerted marked neurite 
      outgrowth-promoting activities, resulting in distinct morphological features 
      depending on the individual structural features. Such activities were not observed 
      for a less sulfated DS preparation derived from porcine skin, which has a 
      monosulfated disaccharide unit [IdoUA-Gal-NAc(4S)] as a predominant unit. The 
      neurite outgrowth-promoting activities of these oversulfated DS preparations and 
      DSD-1-PG were eliminated by the specific enzymatic cleavage of GalNAc-IdoUA linkages 
      characteristic of DS using chondroitinase B. In addition, chemical analysis of the 
      glycosaminoglycan side chains of DSD-1-PG revealed the DS-type structures. These 
      observations suggest potential novel neurobiological functions of oversulfated DS 
      structures and may reflect the physiological neuritogenesis during brain development 
      by mammalian oversulfated DS structures exemplified by the DSD-1 epitope.

AB  - KEY POINTS: Lamprey are cyclostomes, a group of vertebrates that diverged from lines 
      leading to jawed vertebrates (including mammals) in the late Cambrian, 500 million 
      years ago. It may therefore be possible to infer properties of photoreceptors in 
      early vertebrate progenitors by comparing lamprey to other vertebrates. We show that 
      lamprey rods and cones respond to light much like rods and cones in amphibians and 
      mammals. They operate over a similar range of light intensities and adapt to 
      backgrounds and bleaches nearly identically. These correspondences are pervasive and 
      detailed; they argue for the presence of rods and cones very early in the evolution 
      of vertebrates with properties much like those of rods and cones in existing 
      vertebrate species. ABSTRACT: The earliest vertebrates were agnathans - fish-like 
      organisms without jaws, which first appeared near the end of the Cambrian radiation. 
      One group of agnathans became cyclostomes, which include lamprey and hagfish. Other 
      agnathans gave rise to jawed vertebrates or gnathostomes, the group including all 
      other existing vertebrate species. Because cyclostomes diverged from other 
      vertebrates 500 million years ago, it may be possible to infer some of the 
      properties of the retina of early vertebrate progenitors by comparing lamprey to 
      other vertebrates. We have previously shown that rods and cones in lamprey respond 
      to light much like photoreceptors in other vertebrates and have a similar 
      sensitivity. We now show that these affinities are even closer. Both rods and cones 
      adapt to background light and to bleaches in a manner almost identical to other 
      vertebrate photoreceptors. The operating range in darkness is nearly the same in 
      lamprey and in amphibian or mammalian rods and cones; moreover background light 
      shifts response-intensity curves downward and to the right over a similar range of 
      ambient intensities. Rods show increment saturation at about the same intensity as 
      mammalian rods, and cones never saturate. Bleaches decrease sensitivity in part by 
      loss of quantum catch and in part by opsin activation of transduction. These 
      correspondences are so numerous and pervasive that they are unlikely to result from 
      convergent evolution but argue instead that early vertebrate progenitors of both 
      cyclostomes and mammals had photoreceptors much like our own.

AB  - Jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) and jawless vertebrates (cyclostomes) have 
      different adaptive immune systems. Gnathostomes use T- and B-cell antigen receptors 
      belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. Cyclostomes, the lampreys and hagfish, 
      instead use leucine-rich repeat proteins to construct variable lymphocyte receptors 
      (VLRs), two types of which, VLRA and VLRB, are reciprocally expressed by lymphocytes 
      resembling gnathostome T and B cells. Here we define another lineage of T-cell-like 
      lymphocytes that express the recently identified VLRC receptors. Both VLRC(+) and 
      VLRA(+) lymphocytes express orthologues of genes that gnathostome γδ and αβ T cells 
      use for their differentiation, undergo VLRC and VLRA assembly and repertoire 
      diversification in the 'thymoid' gill region, and express their VLRs solely as 
      cell-surface proteins. Our findings suggest that the genetic programmes for two 
      primordial T-cell lineages and a prototypic B-cell lineage were already present in 
      the last common vertebrate ancestor approximately 500 million years ago. We propose 
      that functional specialization of distinct T-cell-like lineages was an ancient 
      feature of a primordial immune system.

TI  - Mouse Wnt9b transforming activity, tissue-specific expression, and evolution.
PG  - 34-46
AB  - The members of the Wnt family of secreted factors have oncogenic potential and 
      important roles as developmental regulators. We report an analysis of mouse Wnt9b 
      (also called Wnt15 and Wnt14b), including its cDNA sequence, chromosomal mapping, 
      epithelial cell transforming activity, adult and embryonic tissue expression 
      patterns, and evolution. We also deduced the full-length amino acid sequence of its 
      close relative, Wnt9a (also called Wnt14), from unannotated genomic DNA sequences in 
      GenBank. Full-length comparisons among Wnt amino acid sequences provide evidence 
      that Wnt9b and Wnt9a are close paralogs of each other and are orthologs of Wnt9 
      genes from shark and hagfish. Mapping Wnt9b to The Jackson Laboratory BSS 
      interspecific backcross panel places it at 63.0 cM on chromosome 11. Sequence 
      comparisons of two pairs of linked Wnt genes (the Wnt9a-Wnt3a pair and the 
      Wnt9b-Wnt3 pair) suggest that they arose from the relatively recent duplication of a 
      single ancestral Wnt gene pair, confirming the close paralogous relationship of 
      Wnt9a and Wnt9b. Wnt9b expression is primarily restricted to the kidney in the adult 
      mouse, with lower levels detected in the preputial gland, liver, and mammary gland. 
      Testing of staged whole mouse embryos from 9.5 to 17.5 days of gestation showed 
      expression at all stages with a peak at day 10.5. In situ hybridization analysis 
      showed expression in most but not all tissues of the 16.5-day embryo. No significant 
      elevation of Wnt9b expression was detected in 29 mouse mammary tumor virus-induced 
      tumors. Overexpression of Wnt9b in C57MG mammary epithelial cells caused small 
      transformed foci in cell monolayers and a moderate morphological transformation in 
      pooled colonies compared with Wnt1.

AB  - Chemokine-induced chemotaxis of leukocytes is an important part of the innate 
      immunity and has been shown to mediate inflammation in all groups of jawed 
      vertebrates. For jawless vertebrates, hagfish leukocytes are known to show 
      chemotaxis toward mammalian complement anaphylotoxin and Gram-negative bacteria 
      lipopolysaccharide. However, whether chemokines mediate chemotaxis of leukocytes in 
      jawless vertebrates has not been conclusively examined. Here, we show C-X-C motif 
      chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8, also named interleukin 8) of the Northeast Chinese 
      lamprey (Lethenteron morii) (designated as LmCXCL8) induces chemotaxis in its 
      leukocytes. We identified LmCXCL8 and found it possesses the characteristic 
      N-terminal cysteine residues and GGR (Gly-Gly-Arg) motif. The Lmcxcl8 gene was found 
      to be expressed in all examined tissues, and its expression was inducible in the 
      lamprey challenged by an infectious bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A recombinant 
      LmCXCL8 protein elicited concentration-dependent chemotaxis in peripheral blood 
      leukocytes isolated from the Northeast Chinese lamprey. Based on these results, we 
      conclude that LmCXCL8 is a constitutive and inducible acute-phase cytokine that 
      mediates immune defense and trace the chemotactic function of chemokine to basal 
      vertebrates.

TI  - A novel protein tyrosine kinase Tec identified in lamprey, Lampetra japonica.
PG  - 639-46
LID - 10.1093/abbs/gmv056 [doi]
AB  - Protein tyrosine kinase Tec, a kind of non-receptor tyrosine kinase, is primarily 
      found to be expressed in T cells, B cells, hematopoietic cells, and liver cells as a 
      cytoplasmic protein. Tec has been proved to be a critical modulator of T cell 
      receptor signaling pathway. In the present study, a homolog of Tec was identified in 
      the lamprey, Lampetra japonica. The full-length Tec cDNA of L. japonica (Lja-Tec) 
      contains a 1923 bp open reading frame that encodes a 641-amino acid protein. The 
      multi-alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of Lja-Tec with typical 
      vertebrate Tecs showed that it possesses all conserved domains of the Tec family 
      proteins, indicating that an ortholog of Tec exists in the extant jawless 
      vertebrate. In the phylogenetic tree that was reconstructed with 24 homologs of 
      jawless and jawed vertebrates, the Tecs from lampreys and hagfish were clustered as 
      a single clade. The genetic distance between the outgroup and agnathan Tecs' group 
      is closer than that between outgroup and gnathostome Tecs' group, indicating that 
      its origin was far earlier than any of the jawed vertebrates. The mRNA levels of 
      Lja-Tec in lymphocyte-like cells and gills were detected by real-time quantitative 
      polymerase chain reaction. Results showed that it was significantly upregulated 
      under stimulation with mixed pathogens. This result was further confirmed by western 
      blot analysis. All these results indicated that Lja-Tec plays an important role in 
      immune response. Our data will provide a reference for the further study of lamprey 
      Tec and its immunological function in jawless vertebrates.

TI  - MECHANICAL PERFORMANCE OF AN IN SITU PERFUSED HEART FROM THE TURTLE CHRYSEMYS 
      SCRIPTA DURING NORMOXIA AND ANOXIA AT 5 C AND 15 C.
PG  - 207-29
AB  - We developed an in situ perfused turtle (Chrysemys scripta) heart preparation to 
      study its intrinsic mechanical properties at 5&deg;C and 15&deg;C using normoxic and 
      anoxic perfusion conditions. The in situ preparation proved durable and stable. At 
      15&deg;C and a spontaneous heart rate of 23.4 beats min-1, maximum stroke volume was 
      2.54 ml kg-1 body mass, maximum cardiac output was 62.5 ml min-1 kg-1 and maximum 
      cardiac myocardial power output was 1.50 mW g-1 ventricular mass. There was good 
      agreement between these values and those previously obtained in vivo. Furthermore, 
      since the maximum stroke volume observed here was numerically equivalent to that 
      observed in ventilating C. scripta in vivo, it seems likely that C. scripta has 
      little scope to increase stroke volume to a level much beyond that observed in the 
      resting animal through intrinsic mechanisms alone. The ability of the perfused 
      turtle heart to maintain stroke volume when diastolic afterload was raised 
      (homeometric regulation) was relatively poor. At 5&deg;C, the spontaneous heart rate 
      (8.1 beats min-1) was threefold lower and homeometric regulation was impaired, but 
      maximum stroke volume (2.25 ml kg-1) was not significantly reduced compared with the 
      value at 15&deg;C. The significantly lower maximum values for cardiac output (18.9 
      ml min-1 kg-1) and power output (0.39 mW g-1 ventricular mass) at 5&deg;C were 
      largely related to pronounced negative chronotropy with only a relatively small 
      negative inotropy. Anoxia had weak negative chronotropic effects and marked negative 
      inotropic effects at both temperatures. Negative inotropy affected pressure 
      development to a greater degree than maximum flow and this difference was more 
      pronounced at 5&deg;C than at 15&deg;C. The maximum anoxic cardiac power output 
      value at 15&deg;C (0.77 mW g-1 ventricular mass) was not that different from values 
      previously obtained for the performance of anoxic rainbow trout and hagfish hearts. 
      In view of this, we conclude that the ability of turtles to overwinter under anoxic 
      conditions depends more on their ability to reduce cardiac work to a level that can 
      be supported through glycolysis than on their cardiac glycolytic potential being 
      exceptional.

TI  - Evidence for at least six Hox clusters in the Japanese lamprey (Lethenteron 
      japonicum).
PG  - 16044-9
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1315760110 [doi]
AB  - Cyclostomes, comprising jawless vertebrates such as lampreys and hagfishes, are the 
      sister group of living jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) and hence an important group 
      for understanding the origin and diversity of vertebrates. In vertebrates and other 
      metazoans, Hox genes determine cell fate along the anteroposterior axis of embryos 
      and are implicated in driving morphological diversity. Invertebrates contain a 
      single Hox cluster (either intact or fragmented), whereas elephant shark, 
      coelacanth, and tetrapods contain four Hox clusters owing to two rounds of 
      whole-genome duplication ("1R" and "2R") during early vertebrate evolution. By 
      contrast, most teleost fishes contain up to eight Hox clusters because of an 
      additional "teleost-specific" genome duplication event. By sequencing bacterial 
      artificial chromosome (BAC) clones and the whole genome, here we provide evidence 
      for at least six Hox clusters in the Japanese lamprey (Lethenteron japonicum). This 
      suggests that the lamprey lineage has experienced an additional genome duplication 
      after 1R and 2R. The relative age of lamprey and human paralogs supports this 
      hypothesis. Compared with gnathostome Hox clusters, lamprey Hox clusters are 
      unusually large. Several conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) were predicted in the 
      Hox clusters of lamprey, elephant shark, and human. Transgenic zebrafish assay 
      indicated the potential of CNEs to function as enhancers. Interestingly, CNEs in 
      individual lamprey Hox clusters are frequently conserved in multiple Hox clusters in 
      elephant shark and human, implying a many-to-many orthology relationship between 
      lamprey and gnathostome Hox clusters. Such a relationship suggests that the first 
      two rounds of genome duplication may have occurred independently in the lamprey and 
      gnathostome lineages.

TI  - Non-ammocoete larvae of Palaeozoic stem lampreys.
PG  - 408-412
LID - 10.1038/s41586-021-03305-9 [doi]
AB  - Ammocoetes-the filter-feeding larvae of modern lampreys-have long influenced 
      hypotheses of vertebrate ancestry(1-7). The life history of modern lampreys, 
      which develop from a superficially amphioxus-like ammocoete to a specialized 
      predatory adult, appears to recapitulate widely accepted scenarios of vertebrate 
      origin. However, no direct evidence has validated the evolutionary antiquity of 
      ammocoetes, and their status as models of primitive vertebrate anatomy is uncertain. 
      Here we report larval and juvenile forms of four stem lampreys from the Palaeozoic 
      era (Hardistiella, Mayomyzon, Pipiscius, and Priscomyzon), including a 
      hatchling-to-adult growth series of the genus Priscomyzon from Late Devonian 
      Gondwana. Larvae of all four genera lack the defining traits of ammocoetes. They 
      instead display features that are otherwise unique to adult modern lampreys, 
      including prominent eyes, a cusped feeding apparatus, and posteriorly united 
      branchial baskets. Notably, phylogenetic analyses find that these non-ammocoete 
      larvae occur in at least three independent lineages of stem lamprey. This 
      distribution strongly implies that ammocoetes are specializations of modern-lamprey 
      life history rather than relics of vertebrate ancestry. These phylogenetic insights 
      also suggest that the last common ancestor of hagfishes and lampreys was a 
      macrophagous predator that did not have a filter-feeding larval phase. Thus, the 
      armoured 'ostracoderms' that populate the cyclostome and gnathostome stems might 
      serve as better proxies than living cyclostomes for the last common ancestor of all 
      living vertebrates.

AB  - The hypothalamic-pituitary (HP) system, which is specific to vertebrates, is 
      considered to be an evolutionary innovation that emerged prior to or during the 
      differentiation of the ancestral jawless vertebrates (agnathans) leading to the 
      neuroendocrine control of many complex functions. Along with hagfish, lampreys 
      represent the oldest lineage of vertebrates, agnathans (jawless fish). This review 
      will highlight our discoveries of the major components of the lamprey HP axis. 
      Generally, gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates) have one or two hypothalamic 
      gonadotropin-releasing hormones (GnRH) while lampreys have three hypothalamic GnRHs. 
      GnRH(s) regulate reproduction in all vertebrates via the pituitary. In gnathostomes, 
      there are three classical pituitary glycoprotein hormones (luteinizing hormone, LH; 
      follicle stimulating hormone, FSH; and thyrotropin, TSH) interacting specifically 
      with three receptors, LH-R, FSH-R, and TSH-R, respectively. In general, FSH and LH 
      regulate gonadal activity and TSH regulates thyroidal activity. In contrast to 
      gnathostomes, we propose that lampreys only have two heterodimeric pituitary 
      glycoprotein hormones, lamprey glycoprotein hormone (lGpH) and thyrostimulin, and 
      two lamprey glycoprotein hormone receptors (lGpH-R I and -R II). Our existing data 
      also suggest the existence of a primitive, overlapping yet functional 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) and HP-thyroidal (HPT) endocrine systems in 
      lampreys. The study of basal vertebrates provides promising models for understanding 
      the evolution of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroidal and gonadal axes in 
      vertebrates. We hypothesize that the glycoprotein hormone/glycoprotein hormone 
      receptor systems emerged as a link between the neuroendocrine and peripheral control 
      levels during the early stages of gnathostome divergence. Our discovery of a 
      functional HPG axis in lamprey has provided important clues for understanding the 
      forces that ensured a common organization of the hypothalamus and pituitary as 
      essential regulatory systems in all vertebrates. This paper will provide a brief 
      snapshot of my discoveries, collaborations and latest findings including 
      phylogenomic analyses on the origins, co-evolution and divergence of ligand and 
      receptor protein families from the perspective of the lamprey hypothalamic-pituitary 
      system.

AB  - Somatic embryogenesis receptor kinases (SERKs) are leucine-rich repeat 
      (LRR)-containing integral membrane receptors that are involved in the regulation of 
      development and immune responses in plants. It has recently been shown that rice 
      SERK2 (OsSERK2) is essential for XA21-mediated resistance to the pathogen 
      Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. OsSERK2 is also required for the BRI1-mediated, 
      FLS2-mediated and EFR-mediated responses to brassinosteroids, flagellin and 
      elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), respectively. Here, crystal structures of the LRR 
      domains of OsSERK2 and a D128N OsSERK2 mutant, expressed as hagfish variable 
      lymphocyte receptor (VLR) fusions, are reported. These structures suggest that the 
      aspartate mutation does not generate any significant conformational change in the 
      protein, but instead leads to an altered interaction with partner receptors.

AB  - Immunologists and evolutionary biologists have been debating the nature of the 
      immune system of jawless vertebrates--lampreys and hagfish--since the nineteenth 
      century. In the past 50 years, these fish were shown to have antibody-like responses 
      and the capacity to reject allografts but were found to lack the 
      immunoglobulin-based adaptive immune system of jawed vertebrates. Recent work has 
      shown that lampreys have lymphocytes that instead express somatically diversified 
      antigen receptors that contain leucine-rich-repeats, termed variable lymphocyte 
      receptors (VLRs), and that the type of VLR expressed is specific to the lymphocyte 
      lineage: T-like lymphocytes express type A VLR (VLRA) genes, and B-like lymphocytes 
      express VLRB genes. These clonally diverse anticipatory antigen receptors are 
      assembled from incomplete genomic fragments by gene conversion, which is thought to 
      be initiated by either of two genes encoding cytosine deaminase, cytosine deaminase 
      1 (CDA1) in T-like cells and CDA2 in B-like cells. It is unknown whether jawless 
      fish, like jawed vertebrates, have dedicated primary lymphoid organs, such as the 
      thymus, where the development and selection of lymphocytes takes place. Here we 
      identify discrete thymus-like lympho-epithelial structures, termed thymoids, in the 
      tips of the gill filaments and the neighbouring secondary lamellae (both within the 
      gill basket) of lamprey larvae. Only in the thymoids was expression of the 
      orthologue of the gene encoding forkhead box N1 (FOXN1), a marker of the 
      thymopoietic microenvironment in jawed vertebrates, accompanied by expression of 
      CDA1 and VLRA. This expression pattern was unaffected by immunization of lampreys or 
      by stimulation with a T-cell mitogen. Non-functional VLRA gene assemblies were found 
      frequently in the thymoids but not elsewhere, further implicating the thymoid as the 
      site of development of T-like cells in lampreys. These findings suggest that the 
      similarities underlying the dual nature of the adaptive immune systems in the two 
      sister groups of vertebrates extend to primary lymphoid organs.

AB  - Host responses against invading pathogens are basic physiological reactions of all 
      living organisms. Since the appearance of the first eukaryotic cells, a series of 
      defense mechanisms have evolved in order to secure cellular integrity, homeostasis, 
      and survival of the host. Invertebrates, ranging from protozoans to metazoans, 
      possess cellular receptors, which bind to foreign elements and differentiate self 
      from non-self. This ability is in multicellular animals associated with presence of 
      phagocytes, bearing different names (amebocytes, hemocytes, coelomocytes) in various 
      groups including animal sponges, worms, cnidarians, mollusks, crustaceans, 
      chelicerates, insects, and echinoderms (sea stars and urchins). Basically, these 
      cells have a macrophage-like appearance and function and the repair and/or fight 
      functions associated with these cells are prominent even at the earliest 
      evolutionary stage. The cells possess pathogen recognition receptors recognizing 
      pathogen-associated molecular patterns, which are well-conserved molecular 
      structures expressed by various pathogens (virus, bacteria, fungi, protozoans, 
      helminths). Scavenger receptors, Toll-like receptors, and Nod-like receptors (NLRs) 
      are prominent representatives within this group of host receptors. Following 
      receptor-ligand binding, signal transduction initiates a complex cascade of cellular 
      reactions, which lead to production of one or more of a wide array of effector 
      molecules. Cytokines take part in this orchestration of responses even in lower 
      invertebrates, which eventually may result in elimination or inactivation of the 
      intruder. Important innate effector molecules are oxygen and nitrogen species, 
      antimicrobial peptides, lectins, fibrinogen-related peptides, leucine rich repeats 
      (LRRs), pentraxins, and complement-related proteins. Echinoderms represent the most 
      developed invertebrates and the bridge leading to the primitive chordates, 
      cephalochordates, and urochordates, in which many autologous genes and functions 
      from their ancestors can be found. They exhibit numerous variants of innate 
      recognition and effector molecules, which allow fast and innate responses toward 
      diverse pathogens despite lack of adaptive responses. The primitive vertebrates 
      (agnathans also termed jawless fish) were the first to supplement innate responses 
      with adaptive elements. Thus hagfish and lampreys use LRRs as variable lymphocyte 
      receptors, whereas higher vertebrates [cartilaginous and bony fishes (jawed fish), 
      amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals] developed the major histocompatibility 
      complex, T-cell receptors, and B-cell receptors (immunoglobulins) as additional 
      adaptive weaponry to assist innate responses. Extensive cytokine networks are 
      recognized in fish, but related signal molecules can be traced among invertebrates. 
      The high specificity, antibody maturation, immunological memory, and secondary 
      responses of adaptive immunity were so successful that it allowed higher vertebrates 
      to reduce the number of variants of the innate molecules originating from both 
      invertebrates and lower vertebrates. Nonetheless, vertebrates combine the two arms 
      in an intricate inter-dependent network. Organisms at all developmental stages have, 
      in order to survive, applied available genes and functions of which some may have 
      been lost or may have changed function through evolution. The molecular mechanisms 
      involved in evolution of immune molecules, might apart from simple base 
      substitutions be as diverse as gene duplication, deletions, alternative splicing, 
      gene recombination, domain shuffling, retrotransposition, and gene conversion. 
      Further, variable regulation of gene expression may have played a role.

AB  - Mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR) are descended 
      from an ancestral corticoid receptor (CR). To date, the earliest CR have been found 
      in lamprey and hagfish, two jawless fish (cyclostomes) that evolved at the base of 
      the vertebrate line. Lamprey CR has both MR and GR activity. Distinct orthologs of 
      the GR and MR first appear in skates and sharks, which are cartilaginous fishes 
      (Chondrichthyes). Aldosterone, the physiological mineralocorticoid in terrestrial 
      vertebrates, first appears in lobe-finned fish, such as lungfish and coelacanth, 
      forerunners of terrestrial vertebrates, but not in sharks, skates or ray-finned 
      fish. Skate MR are transcriptionally activated by glucocorticoids, such as 
      corticosterone and cortisol, as well as by mineralocorticoids such as 
      deoxycorticosterone and (experimentally) aldosterone; skate GR have low affinity for 
      all human corticosteroids and 1α-OH-corticosterone, which has been proposed to be 
      biologically active glucocorticoid. In fish, cortisol is both physiological 
      mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid; in terrestrial vertebrates, cortisol or 
      corticosterone are the physiological glucocorticoids acting through GR, and 
      aldosterone via MR as the physiologic mineralocorticoid. MR have equally high 
      affinity for cortisol, corticosterone and progesterone. We review this evolutionary 
      process through an analysis of changes in sequence and structure of vertebrate GR 
      and MR, identifying changes in these receptors in skates and lobe-fined fish 
      important in allowing aldosterone to act as an agonist at epithelial MR and 
      glucocorticoid specificity for GR. hMR and hGR have lost a key contact between helix 
      3 and helix 5 that was present in their common ancestor. A serine that is diagnostic 
      for vertebrate MR, and absent in terrestrial and fish GR, is present in lamprey CR, 
      skate MR and GR, but not in coelacanth GR, marking the transition of the GR from MR 
      ancestor. Based on the response of the CR and skate MR and GR to corticosteroids, we 
      conclude that the mechanism(s) for selectivity of GR for cortisol and corticosterone 
      and the specificity of aldosterone for MR are incompletely understood. This article 
      is part of a Special Issue entitled 'CSR 2013'.

      and pyrimidine nucleosides (system cib).
PG  - 2914-27
AB  - The human concentrative (Na(+)-linked) plasma membrane transport proteins hCNT1 and 
      hCNT2 are selective for pyrimidine nucleosides (system cit) and purine nucleosides 
      (system cif), respectively. Both have homologs in other mammalian species and belong 
      to a gene family (CNT) that also includes hfCNT, a newly identified broad 
      specificity pyrimidine and purine Na(+)-nucleoside symporter (system cib) from the 
      ancient marine vertebrate, the Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stouti). We now report 
      the cDNA cloning and characterization of cib homologs of hfCNT from human mammary 
      gland, differentiated human myeloid HL-60 cells, and mouse liver. The 691- and 
      703-residue human and mouse proteins, designated hCNT3 and mCNT3, respectively, were 
      79% identical in amino acid sequence and contained 13 putative transmembrane 
      helices. hCNT3 was 48, 47, and 57% identical to hCNT1, hCNT2, and hfCNT, 
      respectively. When produced in Xenopus oocytes, both proteins exhibited 
      Na(+)-dependent cib-type functional activities. hCNT3 was electrogenic, and a 
      sigmoidal dependence of uridine influx on Na(+) concentration indicated a 
      Na(+):uridine coupling ratio of at least 2:1 for both hCNT3 and mCNT3 (cf 1:1 for 
      hCNT1/2). Phorbol myristate acetate-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells led to 
      the parallel appearance of cib-type activity and hCNT3 mRNA. Tissues containing 
      hCNT3 transcripts included pancreas, bone marrow, trachea, mammary gland, liver, 
      prostate, and regions of intestine, brain, and heart. The hCNT3 gene mapped to 
      chromosome 9q22.2 and included an upstream phorbol myristate acetate response 
      element.

      suggested to be involved in salt excretion in saltwater teleosts, whereas they are 
      proposed to be more important in volume regulation in mammals. In this review, we 
      consider an alternative (or perhaps complementary) function of NPs to protect the 
      heart. This hypothesis is based on a number of observations. First, evidence for 
      NPs, or NP-like activity has been found in all vertebrate hearts thus far examined, 
      from osmoconforming saltwater hagfish to euryhaline freshwater and saltwater 
      teleosts to terrestrial mammals. Thus the presence of cardiac NPs appears to be 
      independent of environmental conditions that may variously affect salt and water 
      balance. Second, cardiac stretch is a universal, and one of the most powerful, NP 
      secretagogues. Furthermore, stretch-induced NP release in euryhaline teleosts 
      appears relatively independent of ambient salinity. Third, excessive cardiac stretch 
      that increases end-diastolic volume (EDV) can compromise the mechanical ability of 
      the heart by decreasing actin-myosin interaction (length-tension) or through Laplace 
      effects whereby as EDV increases, the wall tension necessary to maintain a constant 
      pressure must also increase. Excessive cardiac stretch can be produced by factors 
      that decrease cardiac emptying (i.e., increased arterial pressure), or by factors 
      that increase cardiac filling (i.e., increased blood volume, increased venous tone, 
      or decreased venous compliance). Fourth, the major physiological actions of cardiac 
      NPs enhance cardiac emptying and decrease cardiac filling. In fish, NPs promote 
      cardiac emptying by decreasing gill vascular resistance, thereby lowering ventral 
      aortic pressure. In mammals a similar effect is achieved through pulmonary 
      vasodilation. NPs also decrease cardiac filling by decreasing blood volume and 
      increasing venous compliance, the latter producing a rapid fall in central venous 
      pressure. Fifth, the presence of NP clearance receptors in the gill and lung 
      (between the heart and systemic circulation) suggest that these tissues may be 
      exposed to considerably higher NP titers than are systemic tissues. Thus, a decrease 
      in outflow resistance immediately downstream from the heart may be the first 
      response to increased cardiac distension. Because the physiology of cardiac NPs is 
      basically the same in fish and mammals, we propose that the cardioprotective effects 
      of NPs have been well preserved throughout the course of vertebrate evolution. It is 
      also likely that the cardioprotective role of NPs was one of the most primordial 
      homeostatic activities of these peptides in the earliest vertebrates.

      fish.
PG  - 303-35
AB  - The morphology of the gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) system of fish was reviewed with 
      the objective of providing the phylogenetic and ontogenetic development of the 
      system in this vertebrate group, which includes agnathans and gnathostome 
      cartilaginous, actinoptyerygian, and sarcopterygian fish. Particular emphasis is 
      placed on the fish homolog of the endocrine pancreas of other vertebrates, which is 
      referred to as the islet organ. The one-hormone islet organ (B cells) of larval 
      lampreys is the most basic pattern seen among a free-living vertebrate, with the 
      two-hormone islet organ (B and D cells) of hagfish and the three-hormone islet organ 
      (B, D, and F cells) of adult lampreys implying a phylogenetic trend toward the 
      classic four-hormone islet tissue (B, D, F, and A cells) in most other fish. An 
      earlier stage in the development of this phylogenetic sequence in vertebrates may 
      have been the restriction of islet-type hormones to the alimentary canal, like that 
      seen in protochordates. The relationship of the islet organ to exocrine pancreatic 
      tissue, or its equivalent, is variable among bony, cartilaginous, and agnathan 
      fishes and is likely a manifestation of the early divergence of these piscine 
      groups. Variations in pancreatic morphology between individuals of subgroups within 
      both the lamprey and chondrichthyan taxa are consistent with their evolutionary 
      distance. A comparison of the distribution and degree of concentration of the 
      components of the islet organ among teleosts indicates a diffuse distribution of 
      relatively small islets in the generalized euteleosts and the tendency for the 
      concentration into Brockmann bodies of large (principal) islets (with or without 
      secondary islets) in the more derived forms. The holostean actinopterygians 
      (Amiiformes and Semiontiformes) share with the basal teleosts (osteoglossomorphs, 
      elopomorphs) the diffuse arrangement of the components of the islet organ that is 
      seen in generalized euteleosts. Since principal islets are also present in adult 
      lampreys the question arises whether principal islets are a derived or a generalized 
      feature among teleosts. There is a paucity of studies on the ontogeny of the GEP 
      system in fish but it has been noted that the timing of the appearance of the islet 
      cell types parallels the time that they appear during phylogeny; the theory of 
      recapitulation has been revisited. It is stressed that the lamprey life cycle 
      provides a good opportunity for studying the development of the GEP system. There 
      are now several markers of cell differentiation in the mammalian endocrine pancreas 
      which would be useful for investigating the development of the islet organ and cells 
      of the remaining GEP system in fish.

AB  - Deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb) is a nitrite reductase that reduces naturally occurring 
      nitrite to nitric oxide (NO), supplying physiological relevant NO under hypoxic 
      conditions. The nitrite reductase activity is modulated by the allosteric 
      equilibrium between the R and T structures of Hb that also determines oxygen 
      affinity. In the present study we investigated nitrite reductase activity and O(2) 
      affinity in Hbs from ten different vertebrate species under identical conditions to 
      disclose interspecific variations and allow an extended test for a correlation 
      between the rate constant for nitrite reduction and O(2) affinity. We also tested 
      plastic changes in Hb properties via addition of T-structure-stabilizing organic 
      phosphates (ATP and GTP). The decay in deoxyHb during its reaction with nitrite was 
      exponential-like in ectotherms (Atlantic hagfish, carp, crucian carp, brown trout, 
      rainbow trout, cane toad, Indian python and red-eared slider turtle), while it was 
      sigmoid in mammals (harbor porpoise and rabbit). Typically, hypoxia-tolerant species 
      showed a faster reaction than intolerant species. Addition of ATP and GTP decreased 
      O(2) affinity and slowed the rate of nitrite reduction in a concentration-dependent 
      manner. The initial second order rate constant of the deoxyHb-mediated nitrite 
      reduction showed a strong curvilinear correlation with oxygen affinity among all 
      ectothermic vertebrates, and the relationship also applied to plastic variations of 
      Hb properties via organic phosphates. The relationship predicts high nitrite 
      reductase activity in hypoxic tolerant species with high Hb-O(2) affinity and 
      reveals that the decrease in erythrocyte ATP and/or GTP during acclimation to 
      hypoxia in ectotherms increases the erythrocyte NO generating capacity.

TI  - Ampullary sense organs, peripheral, central and behavioral electroreception in 
      chimeras (Hydrolagus, Holocephali, Chondrichthyes).
PG  - 269-89
AB  - Ampullary sense organs are distributed in groups over the head of Hydrolagus colliei 
      with their pores in clusters and innervated by the buccal, hyomandibular and 
      superficial ophthalmic branches of the anterior lateral line nerve. The ampullae 
      contain ciliated sense cells in an alveolate-shaped epithelium, which communicates 
      to the surface through a jelly-filled tube. The sense cells synapse at their bases 
      with the afferent nerve fibers that terminate in the dorsal nucleus of the anterior 
      lateral line lobe of the medulla. The anatomy and ultrastructure support the 
      homology with the ampullae of Lorenzini of elasmobranchs. Single units recorded from 
      the buccal branch of the anterior lateral line nerve are either lateral line or 
      ampullary in character, the former being sensitive only to mechanical stimuli, the 
      latter to both mechanical and to weak electric stimuli. They are also distinguished 
      by the positions of their receptive fields. The electroreceptive units are 
      spontaneously active and are excited by a cathode placed near the opening of their 
      pore and inhibited by an anode. Compound evoked potentials are recorded from beneath 
      the lateral aspect of the tectum in response to weak electric fields in the bath. 
      Each recording locus has a best position and orientation of the electric field. The 
      electric fields are effective if their duration is longer than ca. 2 ms; longer than 
      10 ms makes no difference until an OFF effect becomes distinct at ca. 50 ms. The 
      reception is tuned to low frequencies but is not sensitive to maintained current 
      (DC). Evoked potentials summating moderate numbers of responses are clear at < 1 
      microV/cm. Ratfish were conditioned in a ring-shaped tank to reverse the direction 
      of swimming when an electric field was switched ON. The stimulus was a 5 Hz square 
      wave or the onset of a DC of 1-10 microA between a pair of electrodes on the floor 
      of the tank. The fish responded to fields as weak as 0.2 microV/cm. A specialized 
      sense modality for electroreception, similar to that in elasmobranchs and most other 
      groups of nonteleost fishes, except for Myxini and Neopterygii (holosteans), is 
      present in the subclass Holocephali. The notion is supported that this modality and 
      its central as well as peripheral apparatus arose early in the evolution of 
      vertebrates. Only two losses of the whole system need be hypothesized, on this idea, 
      once in the ancestors of the hagfishes and once in the ancestors of the 
      neopterygians, which include the teleosts. Some orders of teleosts then evolved a 
      new system of electroreception independently. The ciliary receptor cells are 
      probably primitive; microvillar sense cells evolved independently.

      vertebrate evolution.

AB  - The germinal epithelium, i.e., the site of germ cell production in males and 
      females, has maintained a constant form and function throughout 500 million years of 
      vertebrate evolution. The distinguishing characteristic of germinal epithelia among 
      all vertebrates, males, and females, is the presence of germ cells among somatic 
      epithelial cells. The somatic epithelial cells, Sertoli cells in males or follicle 
      (granulosa) cells in females, encompass and isolate germ cells. Morphology of all 
      vertebrate germinal epithelia conforms to the standard definition of an epithelium: 
      epithelial cells are interconnected, border a body surface or lumen, are avascular 
      and are supported by a basement membrane. Variation in morphology of gonads, which 
      develop from the germinal epithelium, is correlated with the evolution of 
      reproductive modes. In hagfishes, lampreys, and elasmobranchs, the germinal 
      epithelia of males produce spermatocysts. A major rearrangement of testis morphology 
      diagnoses osteichthyans: the spermatocysts are arranged in tubules or lobules. In 
      protogynous (female to male) sex reversal in teleost fishes, female germinal 
      epithelial cells (prefollicle cells) and oogonia transform into the first male 
      somatic cells (Sertoli cells) and spermatogonia in the developing testis lobules. 
      This common origin of cell types from the germinal epithelium in fishes with 
      protogynous sex reversal supports the homology of Sertoli cells and follicle cells. 
      Spermatogenesis in amphibians develops within spermatocysts in testis lobules. In 
      amniotes vertebrates, the testis is composed of seminiferous tubules wherein 
      spermatogenesis occurs radially. Emerging research indicates that some mammals do 
      not have lifetime determinate fecundity. The fact emerged that germinal epithelia 
      occur in the gonads of all vertebrates examined herein of both sexes and has the 
      same form and function across all vertebrate taxa. Continued study of the form and 
      function of the germinal epithelium in vertebrates will increasingly clarify our 
      understanding of vertebrate reproduction. J. Morphol. 277:1014-1044, 2016. © 2016

AB  - The vast and complex coast of the Magellan Region of extreme southern Chile 
      possesses a diversity of habitats including fjords, deep channels, and extensive 
      kelp forests, with a unique mix of temperate and sub-Antarctic species. The Cape 
      Horn and Diego Ramírez archipelagos are the most southerly locations in the 
      Americas, with the southernmost kelp forests, and some of the least explored places 
      on earth. The giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera plays a key role in structuring the 
      ecological communities of the entire region, with the large brown seaweed Lessonia 
      spp. forming dense understories. Kelp densities were highest around Cape Horn, 
      followed by Diego Ramírez, and lowest within the fjord region of Francisco Coloane 
      Marine Park (mean canopy densities of 2.51 kg m-2, 2.29 kg m-2, and 2.14 kg m-2, 
      respectively). There were clear differences in marine communities among these 
      sub-regions, with the lowest diversity in the fjords. We observed 18 species of 
      nearshore fishes, with average species richness nearly 50% higher at Diego Ramírez 
      compared with Cape Horn and Francisco Coloane. The number of individual fishes was 
      nearly 10 times higher at Diego Ramírez and 4 times higher at Cape Horn compared 
      with the fjords. Dropcam surveys of mesophotic depths (53-105 m) identified 30 taxa 
      from 25 families, 15 classes, and 7 phyla. While much of these deeper habitats 
      consisted of soft sediment and cobble, in rocky habitats, echinoderms, mollusks, 
      bryozoans, and sponges were common. The southern hagfish (Myxine australis) was the 
      most frequently encountered of the deep-sea fishes (50% of deployments), and while 
      the Fueguian sprat (Sprattus fuegensis) was the most abundant fish species, its 
      distribution was patchy. The Cape Horn and Diego Ramírez archipelagos represent some 
      of the last intact sub-Antarctic ecosystems remaining and a recently declared large 
      protected area will help ensure the health of this unique region.

TI  - Lampreys, the jawless vertebrates, contain only two ParaHox gene clusters.
PG  - 9146-9151

AB  - ParaHox genes (Gsx, Pdx, and Cdx) are an ancient family of developmental genes 
      closely related to the Hox genes. They play critical roles in the patterning of 
      brain and gut. The basal chordate, amphioxus, contains a single ParaHox cluster 
      comprising one member of each family, whereas nonteleost jawed vertebrates contain 
      four ParaHox genomic loci with six or seven ParaHox genes. Teleosts, which have 
      experienced an additional whole-genome duplication, contain six ParaHox genomic loci 
      with six ParaHox genes. Jawless vertebrates, represented by lampreys and hagfish, 
      are the most ancient group of vertebrates and are crucial for understanding the 
      origin and evolution of vertebrate gene families. We have previously shown that 
      lampreys contain six Hox gene loci. Here we report that lampreys contain only two 
      ParaHox gene clusters (designated as α- and β-clusters) bearing five ParaHox genes 
      (Gsxα, Pdxα, Cdxα, Gsxβ, and Cdxβ). The order and orientation of the three genes in 
      the α-cluster are identical to that of the single cluster in amphioxus. However, the 
      orientation of Gsxβ in the β-cluster is inverted. Interestingly, Gsxβ is expressed 
      in the eye, unlike its homologs in jawed vertebrates, which are expressed mainly in 
      the brain. The lamprey Pdxα is expressed in the pancreas similar to jawed vertebrate 
      Pdx genes, indicating that the pancreatic expression of Pdx was acquired before the 
      divergence of jawless and jawed vertebrate lineages. It is likely that the lamprey 
      Pdxα plays a crucial role in pancreas specification and insulin production similar 
      to the Pdx of jawed vertebrates.

TI  - The p53-Mdm2 interaction and the E3 ligase activity of Mdm2/Mdm4 are conserved from 
      lampreys to humans.

AB  - The extant jawless vertebrates, represented by lampreys and hagfish, are the oldest 
      group of vertebrates and provide an interesting genomic evolutionary pivot point 
      between invertebrates and jawed vertebrates. Through genome analysis of one of these 
      jawless vertebrates, the Japanese lamprey (Lethenteron japonicum), we identified all 
      three members of the important p53 transcription factor family--Tp53, Tp63, and 
      Tp73--as well as the Mdm2 and Mdm4 genes. These genes and their products are 
      significant cellular regulators in human cancer, and further examination of their 
      roles in this most distant vertebrate relative sheds light on their origin and 
      coevolution. Their important role in response to DNA damage has been highlighted by 
      the discovery of multiple copies of the Tp53 gene in elephants. Expression of 
      lamprey p53, Mdm2, and Mdm4 proteins in mammalian cells reveals that the p53-Mdm2 
      interaction and the Mdm2/Mdm4 E3 ligase activity existed in the common ancestor of 
      vertebrates and have been conserved for >500 million years of vertebrate evolution. 
      Lamprey Mdm2 degrades human p53 with great efficiency, but this interaction is not 
      blocked by currently available small molecule inhibitors of the human HDM2 protein, 
      suggesting utility of lamprey Mdm2 in the study of the human p53 signaling pathway.

TI  - Design and membrane-disruption mechanism of charge-enriched AMPs exhibiting cell

PG  - 505-22
LID - 10.1007/s00726-015-2104-0 [doi]
AB  - Cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are essential components of the innate immune 
      system, offering protection against invading pathogenic bacteria. In nature, AMPs 
      serve as antibiotics with broad-spectrum antimicrobial and anti-biofilm properties. 
      However, low effective stability in high-salt environments and physiological 
      instability in biological membranes limit the applicability of naturally occurring 
      AMPs as novel therapeutics. We therefore designed short synthetic cationic peptides 
      by substituting key residues in myxinidin, an AMP derived from the epidermal mucus 
      of hagfish, with lysine (Lys, K), arginine (Arg, R), and tryptophan (Trp, W). The 
      resultant myxinidin analogs exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against both 
      Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including multidrug-resistant strains, 
      even under high-salt conditions. Moreover, these peptides showed high binding 
      affinity for both lipopolysaccharides and lipoteichoic acids and inhibited biofilm 
      formation by most bacteria, but did not cause significant lysis of human red blood 
      cells and were not cytotoxic to normal human keratinocytes. Circular dichroism 
      analysis revealed that myxinidin and its analogs assumed α-helical or β-sheet 
      structures within artificial liposomes and bacterial membranes. In addition, 
      bacterial killing and membrane permeation experiments demonstrated that the 
      myxinidin analogs permeated through bacterial membranes, leading to cytoplasmic 
      disruption and cell death. Taken together, these findings suggest myxinidin analogs 
      may be promising candidate antibiotic agents for therapeutic application against 
      antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

AB  - Many responses to adrenal and sex steroids are mediated by receptors that belong to 
      the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors. We investigated the 
      co-evolution of these vertebrate steroid receptors and the enzymes that synthesize 
      adrenal and sex steroids through data mining of genomes from cephalochordates 
      [amphioxus], cyclostomes [lampreys, hagfish], chondrichthyes [sharks, rays, skates], 
      actinopterygii [ray-finned fish], sarcopterygii [coelacanths, lungfishes and 
      terrestrial vertebrates]. An ancestor of the estrogen receptor and 3-ketosteroid 
      receptors evolved in amphioxus. A corticoid receptor and a progesterone receptor 
      evolved in cyclostomes, and an androgen receptor evolved in gnathostomes. Amphioxus 
      contains CYP11, CYP17, CYP19, 3β/Δ5-4-HSD and 17β-HSD14, which suffice for the 
      synthesis of estradiol and Δ5-androstenediol. Amphioxus also contains CYP27, which 
      catalyzes the synthesis of 27-hydroxy-cholesterol, another estrogen. Lamprey 
      contains, in addition, CYP21, which catalyzes the synthesis of 11-deoxycortisol. 
      Chondrichthyes contain, in addition, CYP11A, CYP11C, CYP17A1, CYP17A2. Coelacanth 
      also contains CYP11C1, the current descendent from a common ancestor with modern 
      land vertebrate CYP11B genes, which catalyze the synthesis of cortisol, 
      corticosterone and aldosterone. Interestingly, CYP11B2, aldosterone synthase, 
      evolved from separate gene duplications in at least old world monkeys and two 
      suborders of rodents. Sciurognathi (including mice and rats) and Hystricomorpha 
      (including guinea pigs). Thus, steroid receptors and steroidogenic enzymes 
      co-evolved at key transitions in the evolution of vertebrates. Together, this suite 
      of receptors and enzymes through their roles in transcriptional regulation of 
      reproduction, development, homeostasis and the response to stress contributed to the 
      evolutionary diversification of vertebrates. This article is part of a Special Issue 
      entitled 'Steroid/Sterol signaling'.

AB  - Jawless vertebrates are pivotal representatives for studies of the evolution of 
      adaptive immunity due to their unique position in chordate phylogeny. Lamprey and 
      hagfish, the extant jawless vertebrates, have an alternative lymphocyte-based 
      adaptive immune system that is based on somatically diversifying leucine-rich repeat 
      (LRR)-based antigen receptors, termed variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs). Lamprey 
      T-like and B-like lymphocyte lineages have been shown to express VLRA and VLRB types 
      of anticipatory receptors, respectively. An additional VLR type, termed VLRC, has 
      recently been identified in arctic lamprey (Lethenteron camtschaticum), and our 
      analysis indicates that VLRC sequences are well conserved in sea lamprey (Petromyzon 
      marinus), L. camtschaticum, and European brook lamprey (Lampetra planeri). Genome 
      sequences of P. marinus were analyzed to determine the organization of the 
      VLRC-encoding locus. In addition to the incomplete germ-line VLRC gene, we have 
      identified 182 flanking donor genomic sequences that could be used to complete the 
      assembly of mature VLRC genes. Donor LRR cassettes were classifiable into five basic 
      structural groups, the composition of which determines their order of use during 
      VLRC assembly by virtue of sequence similarities to the incomplete germ-line gene 
      and to one another. Bidirectional VLRC assembly was predicted by comparisons of 
      mature VLRC genes with the sequences of donor LRR cassettes and verified by analysis 
      of partially assembled intermediates. Biased and repetitive use of certain donor LRR 
      cassettes was demonstrable in mature VLRCs. Our analysis provides insight into the 
      unique molecular strategies used for VLRC gene assembly and repertoire 
      diversification.

TI  - Expression and activity of a novel cathelicidin from domestic cats.
PG  - e18756
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0018756 [doi]
LID - e18756
AB  - Cathelicidins are small cationic antimicrobial peptides found in many species 
      including primates, mammals, marsupials, birds and even more primitive vertebrates, 
      such as the hagfish. Some animals encode multiple cathelicidins in their genome, 
      whereas others have only one. This report identifies and characterizes feline 
      cathelicidin (feCath) as the sole cathelicidin in domestic cats (Felis catus). 
      Expression of feCath is predominantly found in the bone marrow, with lower levels of 
      expression in the gastrointestinal tract and skin. By immunocytochemistry, feCath 
      localizes to the cytoplasm of neutrophils in feline peripheral blood. Structurally, 
      the mature feCath sequence is most similar to a subgroup of cathelicidins that form 
      linear α-helices. feCath possesses antimicrobial activity against E. coli D31, 
      Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (IR715), Listeria monocytogenes and 
      Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (clinical isolate) similar to that of the human 
      ortholog, LL-37. In contrast, feCath lacks the DNA binding activity seen with LL-37. 
      Given its similarity in sequence, structure, tissue expression, and antimicrobial 
      activity, the cathelicidin encoded by cats, feCath, belongs to the subgroup of 
      linear cathelicidins found not only in humans, but also non-human primates, dogs, 
      mice, and rats.

TI  - Four functionally distinct C-type natriuretic peptides found in fish reveal 
      evolutionary history of the natriuretic peptide system.
PG  - 10079-84
AB  - Natriuretic peptides (NPs) are major cardiovascular and osmoregulatory hormones in 
      vertebrates. Although tetrapods generally have three subtypes, atrial NP (ANP), 
      B-type NP (BNP), and C-type NP (CNP), some teleosts lack BNP, and sharks and hagfish 
      have only one NP. Thus, NPs have diverged during fish evolution, possibly reflecting 
      changes in osmoregulatory systems. In this study, we found, by cDNA cloning, four 
      distinct CNPs (1 through 4) in the medaka (Oryzias latipes) and puffer fish 
      (Takifugu rubripes), although to our knowledge no more than two CNPs have been 
      isolated from a vertebrate species. Predicted mature CNP-1 was most similar, and 
      CNP-4 was most dissimilar, to mammalian CNPs. However, synthetic CNP-4 most potently 
      activated OlGC1, a medaka CNP-specific receptor (NPR-B) expressed in cultured cells, 
      whereas CNP-1 and CNP-3 most activated OlGC7 and OlGC2, two medaka homologues of the 
      ANP/BNP receptor (NPR-A), respectively. Linkage mapping in medaka followed by 
      comparative genomic analyses among fishes and humans located four CNP genes in 
      separate medaka chromosomes corresponding to human chromosomes 1, 2, 12, and 17. 
      From conserved synteny, the following evolutionary history of NPs was evoked: (i) 
      four CNP genes were generated by chromosomal duplications before the divergence of 
      elasmobranchs; (ii) the CNP-3 gene generated ANP and BNP genes through tandem 
      duplication before the divergence of tetrapods and teleosts; (iii) CNP-1 and -2 
      genes were retained in the teleost lineage but not in the tetrapod lineage; (iv) the 
      CNP-3 gene disappeared from the tetrapod lineage after divergence of amphibians; and 
      (v) the CNP-4 gene is retained in humans as CNP.

AB  - Developmentally programmed genome rearrangements are rare in vertebrates, but have 
      been reported in scattered lineages including the bandicoot, hagfish, lamprey, and 
      zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) [1]. In the finch, a well-studied animal model for 
      neuroendocrinology and vocal learning [2], one such programmed genome rearrangement 
      involves a germline-restricted chromosome, or GRC, which is found in germlines of 
      both sexes but eliminated from mature sperm [3, 4]. Transmitted only through the 
      oocyte, it displays uniparental female-driven inheritance, and early in embryonic 
      development is apparently eliminated from all somatic tissue in both sexes [3, 4]. 
      The GRC comprises the longest finch chromosome at over 120 million base pairs [3], 
      and previously the only known GRC-derived sequence was repetitive and non-coding 
      [5]. Because the zebra finch genome project was sourced from male muscle (somatic) 
      tissue [6], the remaining genomic sequence and protein-coding content of the GRC 
      remain unknown. Here we report the first protein-coding gene from the GRC: a member 
      of the α-soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive fusion protein (NSF) attachment protein 
      (α-SNAP) family hitherto missing from zebra finch gene annotations. In addition to 
      the GRC-encoded α-SNAP, we find an additional paralogous α-SNAP residing in the 
      somatic genome (a somatolog)-making the zebra finch the first example in which 
      α-SNAP is not a single-copy gene. We show divergent, sex-biased expression for the 
      paralogs and also that positive selection is detectable across the bird α-SNAP 
      lineage, including the GRC-encoded α-SNAP. This study presents the identification 
      and evolutionary characterization of the first protein-coding GRC gene in any 
      organism.

AB  - The marine environment has been poorly explored in terms of potential new molecules 
      possessing antibacterial activity. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) offer a new 
      potential class of pharmaceuticals; however, further optimization is needed if AMPs 
      are to find broad use as antibiotics. We focused our studies on a peptide derived 
      from the epidermal mucus of hagfish (Myxine glutinosa L.), which was previously 
      characterized and showed high antimicrobial activity against human and fish 
      pathogens. In the present work, the activities of myxinidin peptide analogues were 
      analyzed with the aim of widening the original spectrum of action of myxinidin by 
      suitable changes in the peptide primary structure. The analysis of key residues by 
      alanine scanning allowed for the design of novel peptides with increased activity. 
      We identified the amino acids that are of the utmost importance for the observed 
      antimicrobial activities against a set of pathogens comprising both Gram-negative 
      and Gram-positive bacteria. Overall, optimized bactericidal potency was achieved by 
      adding a tryptophan residue at the N terminus and by the simultaneous substitution 
      of residues present in positions 3, 4, and 11 with arginine. These results indicate 
      that the myxinidin analogues emerge as an attractive alternative for treating 
      drug-resistant infectious diseases and provide key insights into a rational design 
      for novel agents against these pathogens.

AB  - Healthcare-associated infections resulting from bacterial attachment and biofilm 
      formation on medical implants are posing significant challenges in particular with 
      the emergence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Here, we report the design, 
      synthesis and characterization of self-assembled nanostructures, which integrate on 
      their surface antibacterial peptides. The antibacterial WMR peptide, which is a 
      modification of the native sequence of the myxinidin, a marine peptide isolated from 
      the epidermal mucus of hagfish, was used considering its enhanced activity against 
      Gram-negative bacteria. WMR was linked to a peptide segment of aliphatic residues 
      (AAAAAAA) containing a lipidic tail (C(19)H(38)O(2)) attached to the ε-amino of a 
      terminal lysine to generate a peptide amphiphile (WMR PA). The self-assembly of the 
      WMR PA alone, or combined with coassembling shorter PAs, was studied using 
      spectroscopy and microscopy techniques. The designed PAs were shown to self-assemble 
      into stable nanofiber structures and these nanoassemblies significantly inhibit 
      biofilm formation and eradicate the already formed biofilms of Pseudomonas 
      aeruginosa (Gram-negative bacteria) and Candida albicans (pathogenic fungus) when 
      compared to the native WMR peptide. Our results provide insights into the design of 
      peptide based supramolecular assemblies with antibacterial activity, and establish 
      an innovative strategy to develop self-assembled antimicrobial materials for 
      biomedical applications.

AB  - Vertebrate TLR5 directly binds bacterial flagellin proteins and activates innate 
      immune responses against pathogenic flagellated bacteria. Structural and biochemical 
      studies on the TLR5/flagellin interaction have been challenging due to the technical 
      difficulty in obtaining active recombinant proteins of TLR5 ectodomain (TLR5-ECD). 
      We recently succeeded in production of the N-terminal leucine rich repeats (LRRs) of 
      Danio rerio (dr) TLR5-ECD in a hybrid with another LRR protein, hagfish variable 
      lymphocyte receptor (VLR), and determined the crystal structure of its complex with 
      flagellin D1-D2-D3 domains. Although the structure provides valuable information 
      about the interaction, it remains to be revealed how the C-terminal region of 
      TLR5-ECD contributes to the interaction. Here, we present two methods to obtain 
      recombinant TLR5 proteins that contain the C-terminal region in a baculovirus 
      expression system. First, production of biologically active full-length drTLR5-ECD 
      was substantially enhanced by supplementation of expression culture with purified 
      flagellin proteins. Second, we designed TLR5-VLR hybrids using an LRR hybrid 
      technology by single and double LRR fusions and were able to express diverse regions 
      of drTLR5-ECD, allowing us to detect a previously unidentified TLR5/flagellin 
      interaction. The drTLR5-VLR hybrid technique was also successfully applied to human 
      TLR5-ECD whose expression has been highly problematic. These alternative TLR5 
      expression strategies provide an opportunity to obtain a complete view of the 
      TLR5/flagellin interaction and can be applied to other LRR proteins.

TI  - Functions of chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate chains in brain development. 
      Critical roles of E and iE disaccharide units recognized by a single chain antibody 
      GD3G7.
PG  - 19442-52
AB  - Chondroitin sulfate (CS) and dermatan sulfate (DS) have been implicated in the 
      processes of neural development in the brain. In this study, we characterized 
      developmentally regulated brain CS/DS chains using a single chain antibody, GD3G7, 
      produced by the phage display technique. Evaluation of the specificity of GD3G7 
      toward various glycosaminoglycan preparations showed that this antibody specifically 
      reacted with squid CS-E (rich in the GlcUAbeta1-3GalNAc(4,6-O-sulfate) disaccharide 
      unit E), hagfish CS-H (rich in the IdoUAalpha1-3GalNAc(4,6-O-sulfate) unit iE), and 
      shark skin DS (rich in both E and iE units). In situ hybridization for the 
      expression of N-acetylgalac-tosamine-4-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase in the postnatal 
      mouse brain, which is involved in the biosynthesis of CS/DS-E, showed a widespread 
      expression of the transcript in the developing brain except at postnatal day 7, 
      where strong expression was observed in the external granule cell layer in the 
      cerebellum. The expression switched from the external to internal granule cell layer 
      with development. Immunohistochemical localization of GD3G7 in the mouse brain 
      showed that the epitope was relatively abundant in the cerebellum, hippocampus, and 
      olfactory bulb. GD3G7 suppressed the growth of neurites in embryonic hippocampal 
      neurons mediated by CS-E, suggesting that the epitope is embedded in the neurite 
      outgrowth-promoting motif of CS-E. In addition, a CS-E decasaccharide fraction was 
      found to be the critical minimal structure needed for recognition by GD3G7. Four 
      discrete decasaccharide epitopic sequences were identified. The antibody GD3G7 has 
      broad applications in investigations of CS/DS chains during the central nervous 
      system's development and under various pathological conditions.

TI  - Third component of trout complement. cDNA cloning and conservation of functional 
      sites.
PG  - 6123-34
AB  - Of the 30 distinct complement proteins recognized to date, C3 is probably the most 
      versatile and multifunctional molecule known, interacting with at least 20 different 
      proteins. It plays a critical role in both pathways of complement activation and 
      participates in phagocytic and immunoregulatory processes. Structural and functional 
      analysis of C3 from different species, in addition to phylogenetic information, 
      provides insights into the structural elements mediating the various functions. This 
      study describes the cDNA cloning of one of two isoforms of the third complement 
      component, C3-1, of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) and the analysis of its 
      functional sites. By screening a trout liver lambda gt11 library with anti-trout C3 
      chain-specific antibodies and polymerase chain reaction we have determined the cDNA 
      sequence of trout C3-1. The obtained sequence is in complete agreement with the 
      protein sequence of several tryptic peptides, corresponding to different regions of 
      trout C3-1. C3-1 consists of 1640 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 
      181,497 Da. The sequence contains two potential N-glycosylation sites, one on each 
      chain of C3. The deduced protein sequence showed 44.1, 43.3, 44.2, 44.9, 43.1, 43.8, 
      45.9, 29.9, and 33.1% amino acid identities to human, mouse rat, guinea pig, rabbit, 
      cobra, frog, hagfish, and lamprey C3, whereas the identities to human C4, C5, and 
      alpha 2M are 30.4, 28, and 22.9%, respectively. The trout C3 amino acid sequence 
      shows clusters of high and low similarity to C3 from other species. In the regions 
      of high similarity belong the C3 domains that contain the thiolester site and the 
      properdin binding sites, whereas the regions that correspond to regions of human C3 
      where CR1 and CR2 bind show low amino acid sequence similarity. The deduced amino 
      acid sequence shows that the C3 convertase cleavage site (Arg-Ser) is conserved in 
      trout C3, whereas the factor I cleavage sites are Arg-Ala and Arg-Thr instead of 
      Arg-Ser, which is found in the C3 of other species. Protein sequencing of the trout 
      C3 fragments fixed on zymosan during complement activation confirmed the cleavage of 
      trout C3 by trout C3 convertase and factor I at Arg-Ser and Arg-Thr, respectively.

TI  - Leucine-rich repeats and calponin homology containing 4 (Lrch4) regulates the innate 
      immune response.
PG  - 1997-2008
LID - 10.1074/jbc.RA118.004300 [doi]
AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pathogen-recognition receptors that trigger the 
      innate immune response. Recent reports have identified accessory proteins that 
      provide essential support to TLR function through ligand delivery and receptor 
      trafficking. Herein, we introduce leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and calponin homology 
      containing 4 (Lrch4) as a novel TLR accessory protein. Lrch4 is a membrane protein 
      with nine LRRs in its predicted ectodomain. It is widely expressed across murine 
      tissues and has two expression variants that are both regulated by 
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Predictive modeling indicates that Lrch4 LRRs conform to 
      the horseshoe-shaped structure typical of LRRs in pathogen-recognition receptors and 
      that the best structural match in the protein database is to the variable lymphocyte 
      receptor of the jawless vertebrate hagfish. Silencing Lrch4 attenuates cytokine 
      induction by LPS and multiple other TLR ligands and dampens the in vivo innate 
      immune response. Lrch4 promotes proper docking of LPS in lipid raft membrane 
      microdomains. We provide evidence that this is through regulation of lipid rafts as 
      Lrch4 silencing reduces cell surface gangliosides, a metric of raft abundance, as 
      well as expression and surface display of CD14, a raft-resident LPS co-receptor. 
      Taken together, we identify Lrch4 as a broad-spanning regulator of the innate immune 
      response and a potential molecular target in inflammatory disease.

AB  - The newly created Kawésqar National Park (KNP) and National Reserve (KNR) in 
      southern Chile consists of diverse terrestrial and marine habitats, which includes 
      the southern terminus of the Andes, the Southern Patagonia Ice Fields, sub-Antarctic 
      rainforests, glaciers, fjords, lakes, wetlands, valleys, channels, and islands. The 
      marine environment is influenced by wide ranging hydrological factors such as 
      glacier melt, large terrigenous inputs, high precipitation, strong currents, and 
      open ocean water masses. Owing to the remoteness, rugged terrain, and harsh 
      environmental conditions, little is known about this vast region, particularly the 
      marine realm. To this end, we conducted an integrated ecological assessment using 
      SCUBA and remote cameras down to 600 m to examine this unique and largely unexplored 
      ecosystem. Kelp forests (primarily Macrocystis pyrifera) dominate the nearshore 
      ecosystem and provide habitat for myriad benthic organisms. In the fjords, salinity 
      was low and both turbidity and nutrients from terrigenous sources were high, with 
      benthic communities dominated by active suspension feeders (e.g., Bivalvia, 
      Ascidiacea, and Bryozoa). Areas closer to the Pacific Ocean showed more oceanic 
      conditions with higher salinity and lower turbidity, with benthic communities 
      experiencing more open benthic physical space in which predators (e.g., Malacostraca 
      and Asteroidea) and herbivorous browsers (e.g., Echinoidea and Gastropoda) were more 
      conspicuous components of the community compared to the inner fjords. Hagfish 
      (Myxine sp.) was the most abundant and frequently occurring fish taxa observed on 
      deep-sea cameras (80% of deployments), along with several taxa of sharks (e.g., 
      Squaliformes, Etmopteridae, Somniosidae, Scyliorhinidae), which collectively were 
      also observed on 80% of deep-sea camera deployments. The kelp forests, deep fjords, 
      and other nearshore habitats of the KNR represent a unique ecosystem with minimal 
      human impacts at present. The KNR is part of the ancestral territory of the 
      indigenous Kawésqar people and their traditional knowledge, including the importance 
      of the land-sea connection in structuring the marine communities of this region, is 
      strongly supported by our scientific findings.

AB  - The cyclostomes (jawless vertebrates), comprising lampreys and hagfishes, are the 
      sister group of jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) and are hence an important group 
      for the study of vertebrate evolution. In mammals, three Runx genes, Runx1, Runx2 
      and Runx3, encode transcription factors that are essential for cell proliferation 
      and differentiation in major developmental pathways such as haematopoiesis, 
      skeletogenesis and neurogenesis and are frequently associated with diseases. We 
      describe here the characterization of Runx gene family members from a cyclostome, 
      the Japanese lamprey (Lethenteron japonicum). The Japanese lamprey contains three 
      Runx genes, RunxA, RunxB, and RunxC. However, phylogenetic and synteny analyses 
      suggest that they are not one-to-one orthologs of gnathostome Runx1, Runx2 and 
      Runx3. The major protein domains and motifs found in gnathostome Runx proteins are 
      highly conserved in the lamprey Runx proteins. Although all gnathostome Runx genes 
      each contain two alternative promoters, P1 (distal) and P2 (proximal), only lamprey 
      RunxB possesses the alternative promoters; lamprey RunxA and RunxC contain only P2 
      and P1 promoter, respectively. Furthermore, the three lamprey Runx genes give rise 
      to fewer alternative isoforms than the three gnathostome Runx genes. The promoters 
      of the lamprey Runx genes lack the tandem Runx-binding motifs that are highly 
      conserved among the P1 promoters of gnathostome Runx1, Runx2 and Runx3 genes; 
      instead these promoters contain dispersed single Runx-binding motifs. The 3'UTR of 
      lamprey RunxB contains binding sites for miR-27 and miR-130b/301ab, which are 
      conserved in mammalian Runx1 and Runx3, respectively. Overall, the Runx genes in 
      lamprey seem to have experienced a different evolutionary trajectory from that of 
      gnathostome Runx genes which are highly conserved all the way from cartilaginous 
      fishes to mammals.

AB  - Variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) are unconventional adaptive immune receptors 
      relatively recently discovered in the phylogenetically ancient jawless vertebrates, 
      lamprey and hagfish. VLRs bind antigens using a leucine-rich repeat fold and are the 
      only known adaptive immune receptors that do not utilize an immunoglobulin fold for 
      antigen recognition. While immunoglobulin antibodies have been studied extensively, 
      there are comparatively few studies on antigen recognition by VLRs, particularly for 
      protein antigens. Here we report isolation, functional and structural 
      characterization of three VLRs that bind the protein toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) 
      from zebrafish. Two of the VLRs block binding of TLR5 to its cognate ligand 
      flagellin in functional assays using reporter cells. Co-crystal structures revealed 
      that these VLRs bind to two different epitopes on TLR5, both of which include 
      regions involved in flagellin binding. Our work here demonstrates that the lamprey 
      adaptive immune system can be used to generate high-affinity VLR clones that 
      recognize different epitopes and differentially impact natural ligand binding to a 
      protein antigen.

TI  - Crystal structure of LGR4-Rspo1 complex: insights into the divergent mechanisms of 
      ligand recognition by leucine-rich repeat G-protein-coupled receptors (LGRs).
PG  - 2455-65
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M114.599134 [doi]
AB  - Leucine-rich repeat G-protein-coupled receptors (LGRs) are a unique class of 
      G-protein-coupled receptors characterized by a large extracellular domain to 
      recognize ligands and regulate many important developmental processes. Among the 
      three groups of LGRs, group B members (LGR4-6) recognize R-spondin family proteins 
      (Rspo1-4) to stimulate Wnt signaling. In this study, we successfully utilized the 
      "hybrid leucine-rich repeat technique," which fused LGR4 with the hagfish VLR 
      protein, to obtain two recombinant human LGR4 proteins, LGR415 and LGR49. We 
      determined the crystal structures of ligand-free LGR415 and the LGR49-Rspo1 complex. 
      LGR4 exhibits a twisted horseshoe-like structure. Rspo1 adopts a flat and β-fold 
      architecture and is bound in the concave surface of LGR4 in the complex through 
      electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. All the Rspo1-binding residues are 
      conserved in LGR4-6, suggesting that LGR4-6 bind R-spondins through an identical 
      surface. Structural analysis of our LGR4-Rspo1 complex with the previously 
      determined LGR4 and LGR5 structures revealed that the concave surface of LGR4 is the 
      sole binding site for R-spondins, suggesting a one-site binding model of LGR4-6 in 
      ligand recognition. The molecular mechanism of LGR4-6 is distinct from the two-step 
      mechanism of group A receptors LGR1-3 and the multiple-interface binding model of 
      group C receptors LGR7-8, suggesting LGRs utilize the divergent mechanisms for 
      ligand recognition. Our structures, together with previous reports, provide a 
      comprehensive understanding of the ligand recognition by LGRs.

TI  - Isolation, primary structure, and evolution of the third component of chicken 
      complement and evidence for a new member of the alpha 2-macroglobulin family.
PG  - 2164-74
AB  - Although the third component of complement, C3, has been isolated and its primary 
      structure determined from most living classes of vertebrate, limited information is 
      available on its structure and function for aves, which represent a significant 
      stage in complement evolution. In this study, we present the complete cDNA sequence 
      of chicken C3, the cDNA sequences of the thioester region for two chicken alpha 
      2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M)-related proteins, a simplified method for purifying 
      chicken C3, and an analysis of the C3 convertase and factor I-mediated cleavages in 
      chicken C3. Using the reverse-transcriptase PCR, with degenerate oligonucleotide 
      primers derived from two conserved C3 sequences (GCGEQN/TM, TWLTAY/FV) and liver 
      mRNA as template, we isolated three distinct 220-bp PCR products, one with a high 
      degree of sequence similarity to C3 and two to alpha 2M and pregnancy zone protein 
      from other species. The complete cDNA sequence of chicken C3 was obtained by 
      screening a chicken liver lambda gt10 library with the C3 PCR product and probes 
      from the 5' end of the partial-length C3 clones. The obtained sequence is in 
      complete agreement with the protein sequence of several tryptic peptides of purified 
      chicken C3. Chicken pro-C3 consists of an 18-residue putative signal peptide, a 
      640-residue beta-chain (70 kDa), a 989-residue alpha-chain (111 kDa), and an RKRR 
      linker region. It contains an internal thioester and three potential N-glycosylation 
      sites, all in the alpha-chain. The convertase cleavage site, predicted to be 
      Arg-Ser, was confirmed by sequencing the zymosan-bound C3 fragments generated upon 
      complement activation. NH2-terminal sequencing of the purified C3 chains showed that 
      1) pro-C3 is indeed cleaved at the RKRR linker sequence to generate the mature 
      two-chain molecule, and 2) the beta-chain of chicken C3 is blocked. The deduced 
      amino acid sequence shows 54, 54, 54, 53, 52, 57, and 55% amino acid identities to 
      human, mouse, rat, guinea pig, rabbit, cobra, and Xenopus C3, respectively, and an 
      identity of 44, 31, and 33% to trout, hagfish, and lamprey C3, respectively. The 
      identities to human C4, C5, and alpha 2M are 31, 29 and 23%, respectively. A 
      phylogenetic tree for C3, C4, C5, and alpha 2M-related proteins was constructed 
      based on the sequence data and is discussed.

TI  - Ancient BCMA-like Genes Herald B Cell Regulation in Lampreys.
PG  - 2909-2916
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1900026 [doi]
AB  - The TNF superfamily ligands BAFF and APRIL interact with three receptors, BAFFR, 
      BCMA, and TACI, to play discrete and crucial roles in regulating B cell selection 
      and homeostasis in mammals. The interactions between these ligands and receptors are 
      both specific and redundant: BAFFR binds BAFF, whereas BCMA and TACI bind to either 
      BAFF or APRIL. In a previous phylogenetic inquiry, we identified and characterized a 
      BAFF-like gene in lampreys, which, with hagfish, are the only extant jawless 
      vertebrates, both of which have B-like and T-like lymphocytes. To gain insight into 
      lymphocyte regulation in jawless vertebrates, in this study we identified two 
      BCMA-like genes in lampreys, BCMAL1 and BCMAL2, which were found to be 
      preferentially expressed by B-like lymphocytes. In vitro analyses indicated that the 
      lamprey BAFF-like protein can bind to a BCMA-like receptor Ig fusion protein and to 
      both BCMAL1- and BCMAL2-transfected cells. Discriminating regulatory roles for the 
      two BCMA-like molecules are suggested by their differential expression before and 
      after activation of the B-like lymphocytes in lampreys. Our composite results imply 
      that BAFF-based mechanisms for B cell regulation evolved before the divergence of 
      jawed and jawless vertebrates.

TI  - Evolution of retinoic acid receptors in chordates: insights from three lamprey 
      species, Lampetra fluviatilis, Petromyzon marinus, and Lethenteron japonicum.
PG  - 18

LID - 18
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retinoic acid (RA) signaling controls many developmental processes in 
      chordates, from early axis specification to late organogenesis. The functions of RA 
      are chiefly mediated by a subfamily of nuclear hormone receptors, the retinoic acid 
      receptors (RARs), that act as ligand-activated transcription factors. While RARs 
      have been extensively studied in jawed vertebrates (that is, gnathostomes) and 
      invertebrate chordates, very little is known about the repertoire and developmental 
      roles of RARs in cyclostomes, which are extant jawless vertebrates. Here, we present 
      the first extensive study of cyclostome RARs focusing on three different lamprey 
      species: the European freshwater lamprey, Lampetra fluviatilis, the sea lamprey, 
      Petromyzon marinus, and the Japanese lamprey, Lethenteron japonicum. RESULTS: We 
      identified four rar paralogs (rar1, rar2, rar3, and rar4) in each of the three 
      lamprey species, and phylogenetic analyses indicate a complex evolutionary history 
      of lamprey rar genes including the origin of rar1 and rar4 by lineage-specific 
      duplication after the lamprey-hagfish split. We further assessed their expression 
      patterns during embryonic development by in situ hybridization. The results show 
      that lamprey rar genes are generally characterized by dynamic and highly specific 
      expression domains in different embryonic tissues. In particular, lamprey rar genes 
      exhibit combinatorial expression domains in the anterior central nervous system 
      (CNS) and the pharyngeal region. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the genome 
      of lampreys encodes at least four rar genes and suggest that the lamprey rar 
      complement arose from vertebrate-specific whole genome duplications followed by a 
      lamprey-specific duplication event. Moreover, we describe a combinatorial code of 
      lamprey rar expression in both anterior CNS and pharynx resulting from dynamic and 
      highly specific expression patterns during embryonic development. This 'RAR code' 
      might function in regionalization and patterning of these two tissues by 
      differentially modulating the expression of downstream effector genes during 
      development.

TI  - Evolution and diversification of lamprey antigen receptors: evidence for involvement 
      of an AID-APOBEC family cytosine deaminase.
PG  - 647-56
AB  - The variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) of jawless vertebrates such as lamprey and 
      hagfish are composed of highly diverse modular leucine-rich repeats. Each lymphocyte 
      assembles a unique VLR by rearrangement of the germline gene. In the lamprey genome, 
      we identify here about 850 distinct cassettes encoding leucine-rich repeat modules 
      that serve as sequence templates for the hypervariable VLR repertoires. The data 
      indicate a gene conversion-like process in VLR diversification. Genomic analysis 
      suggested a link between the VLR and platelet glycoprotein receptors. Lamprey 
      lymphocytes express two putative deaminases of the AID-APOBEC family that may be 
      involved in VLR diversification, as indicated by in vitro mutagenesis and 
      recombination assays. Vertebrate acquired immunity could have therefore originated 
      from lymphocyte receptor diversification by an ancestral AID-like DNA cytosine 
      deaminase.
